Revenue from operations fell 14% to 219.61 billion rupees, hurt by a 27% decline in its coal trading unit. The ports-to-power conglomerate's coal trading business is its biggest segment, contributing to 36% of its overall revenue. It saw continued weakness in the reporting quarter as India registered lower coal-fired electricity demand. India's overall power output also declined amid a milder summer, earlier-than-expected monsoon and slowing economic activity, leading to a decline in coal demand. The conglomerate has been expanding its new energy business, which includes solar manufacturing and wind turbines. However, the segment registered an 11% dip in revenue, during the quarter. The clean energy segment's pre-tax profit dropped about 34% to 9.82 billion rupees, while the coal trading division logged a 45% decline 4.85 billion rupees.

Sign up here. Al Shabaab has waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2007 in a bid to topple the internationally-backed central government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of sharia law. \"The group is advancing to other areas after the fall of Tardo,\" Abdullahi said. Somali forces and local clan fighters, known as Macwiisleey, are mobilising for a counterattack, he added. A local elder, a clan fighter and a regional lawmaker confirmed the capture of Tardo - which could help al Shabaab move on to other bigger towns because of its position. Al Shabaab's offensive in the region has escalated since early this year. Previous advances reached within 50 km (30 miles) of the national capital Mogadishu, though Somali forces recaptured those villages. \"We are discussing with Hiraan people about plans to recapture the towns from al Shabaab,\" Abdullahi said. About 100 soldiers had been deployed to reinforce local fighters, he added.

China, the world's largest canola importer, sources nearly all of its imports from Canada but those supplies could be limited by an anti-dumping probe Beijing is conducting. China imposed 100% tariffs on Canadian canola meal and oil this year amid strained diplomatic ties. Sign up here. Australia, the second-largest canola exporter, has been shut out of the Chinese market since 2020, mainly due to Chinese rules to stop the spread of fungal plant disease, but the trial cargoes could reopen trade and reduce Canada's market share. Chinese and Australian officials are finalising a framework to address Beijing's phytosanitary requirements aimed at preventing the spread of blackleg disease, according to two Australian agriculture industry sources briefed on the negotiations. \"It looks like we've found a pathway that works for everyone,\" said one of the sources. \"Now we need to run a few ships and see if it all works.\" The five trial cargoes will be handled by trading companies once the framework is agreed, the sources said. Two trading company sources familiar with the negotiations said the shipments would carry between 150,000 and 250,000 metric tons of Australian canola, also known as rapeseed, to China. The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter. In response to a query from Reuters, Australia's agriculture ministry said: \"This is an active and ongoing government-government discussion and details have not yet been finalised.\" China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China has bought an average of 4 million metric tons of canola, worth over $2 billion, each year for the last five years, for use in cooking oil, renewable fuels, and animal feed. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is currently visiting China , underscoring a warming of ties since his Labor government won power in 2022. The planned shipments follow smaller test deliveries last year, when Australia exported 500 tons of canola to China in both June and July 2024, according to Australian trade data. The negotiations have focused on addressing China's requirement that canola shipments contain less than 1% admixture — impurities such as chaff and broken seeds - and its concerns of blackleg contamination, the two sources briefed on the talks said. Unlike Canadian exporters, who clean their canola before shipping, Australian suppliers often exceed this limit. Additional demand from China should lift Australian canola prices, traders said, but Australia may not be able to fully replace Canadian canola in China. The Australian government expects the upcoming harvest later this year to produce 5.7 million tons of canola, the least in five years, due to unfavourable weather and a smaller planted area. Of that, Australia will likely export around 4 million tons of canola, much of which may be earmarked for longstanding customers in Europe and elsewhere, said one of the trade sources. \"China might struggle to get more than their trial volume depending on how quick they move,\" the person said. China had 159,000 tons of imported canola in its stockpiles as of July 4, the lowest level for this time of year in nearly four years, said Zhang Deqiang, an analyst at Shandong-based Sublime China Information.

On the fifth day of a China visit where the Australian leader is balancing trade and security, Albanese visited the Great Wall to draw a comparison with former prime minister Gough Whitlam who walked the wall in 1971, opening dialogue with communist China before Australia's ally the United States had done so.

Australia has blocked some Chinese investments in critical minerals, and company executives have told Reuters that security screening of renewable energy and key infrastructure has also stepped up. Australia supplies around half of the world's lithium as well as other minerals including rare earths used in batteries for electric cars and defence, and is seeking to boost trade with the U.S. amid a global push to diversify supply chains away from dominant producer China. Albanese said on Wednesday that it was in Australia's interest to have a positive relationship with China and not be defined by differences. To underline the point, Albanese said he was following in the footsteps of the Labor leader Whitlam, who made \"a decision that took courage\" to visit and recognise the People's Republic of China in a changing world. \"It's important that we build stability and security in our world, and part of that has to be positive engagement,\" he added.

REUTERS/Blair Gable/File photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab By Promit Mukherjee and David Ljunggren OTTAWA, July 21 (Reuters) - Canadian businesses see less chance of a worst-case tariffs scenario but remain cautious and are keeping hiring and investment under check, the Bank of Canada said in a regular quarterly survey on Monday. Sign up here. Firms' short-term inflation expectations have returned to levels observed at the end of last year and the number of businesses planning for recession has declined slightly, the bank's Business Outlook Survey said. Earlier this year firms had fretted that U.S. tariffs would hit the economy hard, triggering inflation, weak economic growth and joblessness. But their impact has largely been contained to the steel, aluminum and automobile sectors. Inflation, job numbers and the economy have not deteriorated markedly. \"Tariffs and related uncertainty ... continue to have major impacts on businesses' outlooks. However, the worst-case scenarios that firms envisioned last quarter are now seen as less likely to occur,\" the survey said. Around one-third of the firms expect higher tariff-related costs, down from roughly two-thirds in the last quarter, the bank said. A separate monthly survey of business leaders suggests the outlook amongst companies, especially exporters, improved as few have been directly affected by the tariffs so far. But there is still widespread uncertainty on how the U.S. measures and their impacts will play out in the economy. The business outlook indicator - a metric of what business prospects look like under current economic conditions - fell to its lowest level in a year to a negative 2.42. The quarterly survey said around 35% of the firms reported their indicators of order books, advance bookings and sales inquiries had deteriorated compared with 12 months ago as against 29% who said indicators had improved. Investment intentions remain muted, the survey said, adding the balance of opinion is well below its long-term average. Analysts and economists say the business outlook survey gives the central bank more teeth to take a call on rates. The Bank of Canada has kept its key rate steady at 2.75% since April. Only around 12% of the current money market bets show a likely cut on July 30 when the bank will announce its monetary policy decision. A separate survey by the central bank into consumer expectations showed 64.5% of Canadians expect a recession within the next 12 months, down from 66.5% in the first quarter. \"The trade conflict is leading consumers to become increasingly cautious about their spending plans and to change their spending behavior,\" the report said.

Sign up here. \"If we get the calibration of incentives right across our monetary operating framework and regulatory frameworks, reserves should be neither scarce nor abundant - just ample,\" he said at an event hosted by the OMFIF central banking think tank. The BoE is currently unwinding its past quantitative easing asset prices at a pace of 100 billion pounds ($134 billion) a year - although some investors think this will slow over the next 12 months - and COVID-era liquidity provided to banks is expiring. As a result, banks will need to make increasing use of the BoE's weekly auctions of 7-day and 6-month funds, which they can access in exchange for high-quality collateral such as British government bonds and certain loans. Benjamin said banks needed to ensure they had sufficient suitable assets to use as collateral both in good times and bad. \"It is important that they ... maintain enough 'dry powder' to source additional reserves from us in stress and also consider what collateral they have available to source liquidity from private-sector funding markets,\" he said. The growing role of financial firms other than banks in British lending markets also made it important to create incentives so that banks with direct access to BoE liquidity facilities lent funds to other firms, Benjamin added. To achieve this, the BoE wanted to ensure that banks \"would also have incentives not to hoard excess and unneeded liquidity, and would instead redistribute it to the rest of the system where it might be more needed.\" ($1 = 0.7472 pounds) Reporting by David Milliken; editing by Suban Abdulla, William Maclean Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab"

REUTERS/Isabel Infantes Summary Companies Bailey stresses IMF's role in tackling global economic imbalances IMF criticized by US for overreach, Bailey supports multilateral solutions Bailey advocates digital payment tech, sceptical of retail central bank digital currency LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday the International Monetary Fund had a key role to play in tackling the buildup of risky imbalances in the world economy, many of them coming from the United States and China. In a speech he was due to give to Britain's finance elite, Bailey acknowledged the concerns of U.S. President Donald Trump 's administration about the danger of IMF overreach. Sign up here. But the BoE boss said attempts to fix the problems in the world economy - chief among them the big U.S. trade and current account deficits alongside China's big surpluses and its weak domestic demand - had to be resolved at the multilateral level. \"If it is only done at the national level, we will get less good policymaking,\" he was due to tell the annual Mansion House dinner. Bailey has previously stressed the importance of the IMF and other multilateral bodies at a time of heightened trade tensions following Trump's imposition of high import tariffs and his threats to go further. The IMF recently criticised another part of Trump's economic programme - its plans for massive tax cuts. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused the Fund of straying too far from its core economic stability and surveillance missions. Bailey said countries running big deficits were typically the ones that come under the most pressure in financial markets. \"We have seen market disturbance this year. We have to be highly alert to financial stability risks – something that I can assure you we are following closely,\" he said. Bailey also said China should free up its domestic demand as part of a global plan to tackle \"excess imbalances before dangerous levels of trade restrictions come into play, and before we face the prospect of difficult adjustment with macroeconomic volatility and financial instability.\" Bailey said the IMF should consider using its powers to convene talks with member countries - chief among them the U.S. - as well as working with the World Trade Organisation to produce a nuanced assessment of the global trading system. \"I think it helps to remember that the key challenge we all face is to increase growth in the world economy: to grow the pie to support living standards for the people we serve, all of the time,\" Bailey said. \"It is as simple as that.\" He said he would use his new role as head of the Financial Stability Board - grouping global financial regulators - to develop with the IMF resilience tests for the global financial system, including firms such as hedge funds and banks. Bailey also said in his speech that he favoured using digital payment technology for retail payments and bank accounts as a next step for the industry. He said he was unconvinced about the need for a retail central bank digital currency, and that stablecoins were not a substitute for commercial bank money.

The central bank left its benchmark rate (ILINR=ECI) , opens new tab at 4.50% for the 12th meeting in a row, as expected. Some analysts had believed rate cuts could come as soon as August, but Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said policymakers would remain cautious.

Yaron has long said the risk premium and inflation needed to ease before rate cuts could begin. In addition to inflation nearing the target, the shekel has appreciated more than 7% in the past few weeks and would likely help to lower inflation. The risk premium is still relatively high despite the recent decline, Yaron noted. The bank's last move was to reduce the key rate by 25 basis points in January 2024 after inflation eased and economic growth slowed in the early days of the Gaza war. It has said it is in no rush to ease again while inflation remains above target, and 10 of 11 analysts polled by Reuters had expected no move on Monday. The bank said it forecast inflation would be around the midpoint of its target range in a year's time. The economy grew an annualised 3.7% in the first quarter after a 1% expansion for all of 2024.

BHP, meanwhile, still awaits judgment following a trial of the underlying lawsuit over the dam collapse, in which Pogust Goodhead said it was seeking damages of up to 36 billion pounds.

In a sign of how nervous markets are, the Ministry of Finance's first sale of super-long government debt since a bruising electoral defeat for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba logged the weakest demand in almost 14 years. Sign up here. In a whirlwind day of news, the United States and Japan announced a trade deal, speculation swirled that Ishiba planned to resign , and a Bank of Japan (BOJ) official warned of an economic slowdown. The 10-year JGB yield jumped as much as 10 basis points (bps) to 1.6%, marking its biggest move in months and the highest level since October 2008. Super-long term JGB yields hit record highs in May and are back near those levels as concerns mount over Japan's precarious finances. \"We're seeing a possible buyers' strike playing through,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone. \"Inflation is running far too hot for where interest rates are. The question is why would you buy at these levels?\" he said, adding he expected the selloff could extend to UK gilts too. Sunday's defeat for Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party and coalition partner Komeito follows their loss of a majority in the more powerful lower house last year. Opposition parties have advocated for tax cuts and increased government spending to help households deal with inflation. Ishiba plans to resign , a source close to the prime minister said. Local media reported the move could happen by the end of next month. However, the prime minister later said there was no truth to the media reports about his intentions. \"Attention will soon turn to the next prime minister's policy agenda and any signals of recalibration from the BOJ as JGB yields climb,\" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo. After the election defeat, investors expect whoever replaces the fiscally conservative Ishiba will support calls for more government spending, widening an already bloated fiscal deficit at nearly 2-1/2 times the size of Japan's economy. The election result also puts the Bank of Japan in a double bind as prospects of increased spending could keep inflation elevated while potentially prolonged political paralysis and the impact of the trade war provide compelling reasons to go slow on rate hikes. \"The market's first instinct was to mark up political risk premia,\" said Shoki Omori, chief desk strategist at Mizuho Securities, referring to reports of Ishiba's resignation. Investors may struggle to position for the uncertainties around the multiple risks, and \"consequently, the super-long sector may continue to exhibit subdued conditions through August, and possibly into September,\" he said. Ten-year Japanese government bond futures tumbled as much as 1.06 yen to 137.54 yen, their lowest since March 28. Japan's finance ministry has scaled back its issuance plan for super-long bonds in response to the surge in JGB yields and poor demand at auctions. The central bank is due to meet again on policy next week. BOJ Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida said that the trade deal with the U.S. reduces uncertainty, after earlier warning that economic activity and prices were skewed to the downside.

    "full_text": "Summary Biya plans to run in October, seeking eighth term Announcement sparks outcry in press, social media Security, economic challenges building up YAOUNDE, July 14 (Reuters) - In June 2004, on returning from yet another extended stay abroad, Cameroon President Paul Biya came down from his plane and poked fun at rumours he was dead. \"People are interested in my funeral,\" he told reporters. \"I'll see them in 20 years.\" Sign up here. That was 21 years ago, and the world's oldest serving head of state still has no plans to go anywhere. On Sunday he announced on X he would run in Cameroon's presidential election scheduled for October 12 , seeking an eighth term that could keep him in office until he is nearly 100. Biya has held a tight grip on power since taking over as president in 1982 from his one-time mentor Ahmadou Ahidjo, whom he later sidelined and forced into exile. Now, an unprecedented public outcry in the press and on social media since his announcement suggests cracks in that power base, and doubts in his ability to keep going, may be growing. \"Nous sommes foutus\" (\"We are screwed!\") was the front-page headline in Monday's edition of Le Messager newspaper next to a picture of Biya. The cocoa- and oil-producing Central African nation faces a host of economic and security challenges, notably a conflict with Anglophone separatists and threats from Nigeria-based Islamist fighters in the north. Meanwhile Biya, 92, remains largely out of public view, spurring widespread speculation over who is really in charge. \"Most of us don't believe Biya is actually running the country anymore. His decision to run again, if it's really his, shows just how out of touch the system is,\" tech entrepreneur Rebecca Enonchong told Reuters. Communications Minister Rene Emmanuel Sadi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. He has previously said Biya is in good health and that speculation to the contrary was \"pure fantasy and imagination\" by critics aiming to destabilise the country. Last year, the government banned public discussion of Biya's health - though that order has been largely ignored by Cameroon's vociferous press. CALLS TO STEP ASIDE Cameroon has had just two presidents since independence from France and Britain in the early 1960s and is likely to face a messy succession crisis if Biya becomes too ill to remain in office or dies. In 2008, Biya signed a constitutional amendment removing a two-term limit for the presidency. That paved the way for landslide wins in 2011 and 2018, according to official figures, though his opponents complained of irregularities including ballot stuffing and intimidation, which the government denied. Not much has changed since the last vote, both on the security front and for Cameroonians grappling daily with poor access to basic amenities from roads and water to electricity and waste management. \"These issues are not new. They have simply intensified because the situation keeps worsening,\" said Pippie Hugues Marcelline, research policy analyst at the Yaounde-based Nkafu Policy Institute, a think tank. What is different this year, Marcelline said, is \"the level of engagement and awareness\" about Biya's performance. \"A president needs to be seen in charge and in control. The absence of the president from the public is enough evidence that age is not on his side.\" Prominent human rights lawyer Alice Nkom published a video last week on YouTube appealing to Biya to step aside. \"The legs are no longer holding up, the brain is no longer working. I'm telling you this because I'm in this situation, because I'm in my 80s,\" she said. \"I know what has changed in me and what I can no longer give to Cameroonians.\" Perhaps more worrying for Biya, two former allies have recently quit the ruling coalition and announced plans to run in the election separately. Enonchong, the tech entrepreneur, told Reuters she did not think Cameroonians would accept another Biya term. But analyst Raoul Sumo Tayo said that, despite the many obstacles, Biya should not be counted out. \"The ruling party can successfully rally the administrative elite and utilise outdated electoral practices,\" he said, referring to what he described as fraudulent tactics. \"It might just secure an eighth term for Paul Biya.\" Reporting by Amindeh Blaise Atabong and by Robbie Corey-Boulet in Dakar; Editing by Andrew Heavens Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights"

The personnel moves, announced late on Tuesday in a series of presidential decrees, affect nearly all branches of the armed forces. They include the appointment of new chiefs of staff for the infantry, air force and navy as well as the promotion of eight brigadier generals to the rank of major general. Sign up here. One of the promoted generals is the coordinator of the elite Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR), a special forces unit often deployed in counter-terrorism operations and seen as central to Biya's security apparatus. The decrees also named a new special presidential military adviser. The decrees were published two days after Biya, in power since 1982, announced he would run for his eighth term in office in Cameroon's presidential election scheduled for October 12. The seven-year term could keep him in office until he is nearly 100. The announcement prompted an unprecedented public outcry in the press and on social media in Cameroon, where Biya's age and long absences have raised questions about his fitness to rule. The government has said Biya is in good health and dismissed any suggestions otherwise. The decrees concerning the armed forces reflect \"a strategy by President Biya and his collaborators to consolidate power by building a fortress of loyal army generals around him\" that can suppress any protest to his continued rule, said Anthony Antem, peace and security analyst at the Nkafu Policy Institute in Yaounde. Celestin Delanga, researcher at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), said the decrees \"come in a unique political and security context.\" Biya wants to ensure stability during and after the election and \"additional trusted personnel are needed\" for that, he said. The cocoa- and oil-producing Central African nation also faces a host of serious security challenges, notably a conflict with Anglophone separatists and threats from Nigeria-based Islamist fighters in the north. The government gave no explanation for the overhaul. The last significant military shake-up in Cameroon came just last year, shortly after Biya returned in October from his latest extended stay abroad which revived speculation about his health.

Landlocked Central African Republic, roughly the size of France and with a population of around 5.5 million, is deeply impoverished despite being rich in resources including gold, diamonds and timber. It has witnessed waves of instability, including coups and rebellions, since independence from France in 1960. Touadera won a second term in 2020, though militants including the Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC) have fought to overturn that result. The army, backed by United Nations peacekeepers and Russian and Rwandan troops, has been fighting the group for years. Touadera's current term was supposed to be his last, but in 2023 the country held a constitutional referendum that abolished the two-term limit and extended the presidential mandate from five to seven years. Opposition parties and civil society groups have said the new constitution, which was backed by more than 95% of voters, could allow Touadera to stay in power for life.

REUTERS/Pablo Sanhueza Summary Government says land owners will be compensated Plans for memorial at the site Resident says they were unaware of dictatorship's activities VILLA BAVIERA, July 23 (Reuters) - Chile plans to expropriate a settlement founded by a German cult leader where torture took place during former dictator Augusto Pinochet's military regime as the government takes another step to shine a light on a dark period of the past. The enclave, originally called Colonia Dignidad and renamed Villa Baviera, was founded in 1961 by Paul Schafer, a former Nazi medic turned evangelical preacher who kept the isolated community under tight control and was later jailed for sexually abusing children. Sign up here. During Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship, Colonia Dignidad also bore witness to another kind of abuse: the torture of political prisoners by military forces in a secret prison at the site. Schafer collaborated with Pinochet's secret police and in exchange was shielded for years from prosecution for his own crimes. The dictatorship viewed the secretive, fortified and remote community as an ideal site to detain and torture dissidents away from public view. The government now wants to turn the 290-acre (117-hectare) community into a memorial, Justice Minister Jaime Gajardo said at an event this month. The aim is to make it \"a place that allows all Chileans to enter freely to learn about what happened there,\" Gajardo said. \"Nothing justifies violating human rights as they were violated during the military dictatorship.\" Several hundred families once lived at the settlement about 350 kilometers (217 mi) south of Santiago. Today the population numbers closer to 100, many of whom are descendants of the original German settlers. Businesses at Villa Baviera, or Bavarian Village, have tried in recent years to attract visitors to the area's picturesque green fields and views of snow-capped mountains. In the expropriation, property owners will be compensated under terms still to be determined by experts, Gajardo said. The government aims to complete the expropriation before President Gabriel Boric leaves office in March. The justice minister said the community consists of about 90 land parcels but did not specify the number of businesses or residents. PAINFUL PAST Dozens of physically and mentally traumatized members of Colonia Dignidad eventually relocated to Germany , and the site's history drew international attention in the 2015 film \"Colonia.\" Plans for the expropriation underscore the challenges for governments in coming to terms with complicated histories in places that have overlapping layers of rights abuses. Chile's National Institute of Human Rights in a recent report , opens new tab said those who were tortured by Pinochet's forces as well as the people who suffered under Schaefer's control were equally victims of Colonia Dignidad. Jose Patricio Schmidt, who grew up in Colonia Dignidad and still lives there, said residents had existed in a bubble, unaware of the dictatorship's abuses. \"Schaefer would gather us together to read the Bible in a place about a kilometer from where people were tortured, and we knew nothing,\" he said in an interview at a memorial site in the community that pays tribute to the torture victims. Tens of thousands of people were arrested and tortured throughout Chile during Pinochet's rule, and 1,469 people were victims of forced disappearance. Some have criticized the government's move to take away property from current Villa Baviera community members, especially those who were themselves victims of abuse. Juergen Szurgeleis in an interview said he tried as a boy to escape forced labor and abuse at Colonia Dignidad. \"Is it my fault for being born here?\" he said. \"And now they want to take away my land and leave me in the street?\" Yet a former political prisoner at Colonia Dignidad, Luis Jaque, said he struggles to see how the community, which includes a German restaurant and a hotel catering to tourists, can carry on without recognizing the horrors of the past. \"It's not reconcilable, at least not for me,\" he said.

China had heard \"every word\" the U.S. had said at the WTO about its trade practices and is open to discussing tariffs, industrial policy and some benefits it gains from its developing country status, as part of broader conversations on reform ahead of a 2026 ministerial meeting in Cameroon, the delegate said. Sign up here. The official declined to be identified. China's mission does not publicly identify delegates below ambassador rank. China recalled its WTO ambassador in April to become a trade negotiator and the vacant position has yet to be filled. The delegate's remarks follow months of trade tension between the world's two largest economies over sweeping tariffs imposed by the U.S. and retaliatory measures by China. Washington argues there can be no meaningful WTO reform until China and other major economies relinquish privileges known as Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) granted to developing countries, which the U.S. says give them an unfair advantage. Some major economies, including China and Saudi Arabia, self-identify as developing countries, granting them access to SDT benefits such as setting higher tariffs and using subsidies. The delegate said China's developing country status was non-negotiable, but it might forgo SDT in upcoming negotiations, as it did recently on fisheries and domestic regulations. \"I see that in the coming negotiations, generally speaking, I don't think China will ask for the SDT,\" the delegate told Reuters. However, former WTO spokesperson Keith M. Rockwell, a senior research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation, was sceptical that China would fully relinquish SDT in areas like agriculture. The U.S. opposes countries picking and choosing SDT benefits, and wants China to completely renounce them. The delegate said China was open to discussing subsidies to ensure a fairer playing field provided it was met with goodwill in return. But it would not accept any attempts to try to change its economic system, they added. Following positive trade talks in Geneva and London , China indicated openness towards discussing tariffs within the WTO. \"We welcome the U.S. to come back to the WTO,\" the delegate said. \"We are ready to renegotiate on Article 28 if the U.S. raises their requests here at the WTO.\" Article 28 of the WTO Agreement allows members to modify tariff commitments under certain conditions, providing a potential pathway for adjustments.

Since the deal was announced on March 4 to sell 43 of CK Hutchison's ports in 23 countries, including two along the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock, (BLK.N) , opens new tab and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte's family-run shipping company MSC, it has sparked a firestorm of criticism from China. Sign up here. While the U.S. government might oppose the inclusion of state-run COSCO over perceived geopolitical risks posed by Chinese influence, bringing in the shipping giant could provide a more level playing field rather than one company being dominant, said a person with knowledge of the deal. The complex deal would require approval from around 50 jurisdictions involved, and it would take at least two years for the process to be completed, sources and analysts said. There was no immediate response from the White House, COSCO and CK Hutchison to Reuters' requests for comment. At a time of festering global trade tensions between China and the U.S., the deal showcases the growing rivalry between both sides for maritime influence in the strategic commercial shipping sector that has been dominated by China in recent decades. U.S. President Donald Trump had earlier called for the removal of Chinese ownership in the Panama Canal - now used for more than 40% of U.S. container traffic valued at $270 billion annually. Following months of pressure from Beijing, including Chinese state media lambasting the move as a betrayal, and various Chinese government departments saying they would conduct a legal review, CK Hutchison announced on July 28 that a Chinese investor was being courted. It also said changes to the composition of the consortium and structure of the transaction would be necessary to secure regulatory approval. Two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the investor was COSCO (1199.HK) , opens new tab - a shipping and ports conglomerate that is now one of the world's dominant, vertically integrated marine transportation firms. While any stake by COSCO is not yet clear, a triparty agreement with BlackRock and MSC would alleviate China's national security concerns and have its blessing, the sources said. \"The potential acquisition of Hutchison Ports is driven by the strategic need to secure key port resources amid global competition and U.S.-China tensions,\" JPMorgan wrote in a research report. The report also noted that while the inclusion of COSCO would \"relieve some concerns by the Chinese government, thus boosting the likelihood of a green-light scenario\", not all ports in the original agreement might be included. COSCO is requesting a bigger stake while the other parties in the consortium are keen to keep it a minority, the sources said. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters on Monday in response to a question on the deal that Beijing \"will conduct lawful regulation, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and uphold justice and fairness in the market.\" 'STRIP CHINESE CONTROL' A deal involving COSCO would be a \"loud reaffirmation of China's geopolitical influence across the global maritime trade and transport sector, and of its effective leverage in trade negotiations with the U.S.,\" Isaac Kardon, Senior Fellow for China Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Reuters. \"Beijing's disapproval clearly forced Hutchison to back off and change tack — and not merely in the optics of the transaction, but in its basic structure and national ownership.\" Should the deal proceed, it would be a crucial off-ramp for CK Hutchison, with the Americans wary of COSCO's growing maritime heft that could undermine U.S. national security. There could also be further blowback amid ongoing and complex bilateral trade talks. Some analysts say the Panama ports, in particular, will be a focus for the Trump administration, and could be taken out of the transaction to meet U.S. strategic interests. \"The inclusion of this behemoth Chinese central state-owned enterprise as an owner seems like it should be a non-starter for the Trump administration seeking to strip Chinese control and restore some kind of American suzerainty over the Canal Zone,\" added Kardon. The CK Hutchison assets up for sale span the globe, including ports in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Barcelona in Spain, Felixstowe in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Poland and the Bahamas - enlarging Beijing's global shipping networks and options at a time of great trade and tariff uncertainties. \"At the moment they (Beijing) are in a place generally where they want to assert themselves and say, hey, don’t mess with us,\" said Andrew Cainey, a senior associate fellow with the defence and security thinktank RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) in London. \"If the U.S. were to come back and object to it, China could try to block the deal or demand more (from CK Hutchison).\" Reporting by James Pomfret, Clare Jim and Anne Marie Roantree in Hong Kong, Davide Barbuscia in New York, Ryan Woo in Beijing; Editing by Saad Sayeed Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights"

The Hong Kong conglomerate's plan to sell the business, which would include two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock (BLK.N) , opens new tab and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte's family-run shipping company MSC, has become politicised amid an escalating China-U.S. trade war. Sign up here. Negotiations for the deal, which covers 43 ports in 23 countries, are on an exclusive basis between CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, and the consortium for 145 days until Sunday, according to the terms announced in March. The deal talks, however, are unlikely to collapse if the two parties do not ink a pact by Sunday, with three people close to the ports-to-telecoms conglomerate saying the parties could extend the deadline to continue exclusive negotiations. The first part of the deal - definitive documentation to sell two port operations near the Panama Canal - was also not signed by an April 2 deadline set in the sales announcement. The people declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. BlackRock declined to comment. CK Hutchison and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, which CK Hutchison said in May was the main investor in the consortium, did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed the deal as \"reclaiming\" the Panama Canal, after his administration previously called for the removal of what it said was Chinese ownership of the ports near the canal. But in April, China's top market regulator said that it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison's planned sale and that parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review Beijing's stance on the planned deal was made public after pro-China media launched a stinging criticism, saying China had significant national interests in the transaction and it would be a betrayal of the country. \"I think at this moment it's not very optimistic that they can directly sell the ports to the consortium,\" said Jackson Chan, global fixed income senior manager at FSMOne Hong Kong, which has clients holding CK Hutchison bonds. \"The market has already digested the news, even if it announces next week that it won't sell anymore, I don't think it'll be a shock because the market understands it wouldn't have a large impact on its operations.\" DEAL RISKS CK Hutchison shares, which jumped 33% the following two days after the deal was announced in early March, erased all of the gains by mid-April. But since then it regained lost ground along with the rise in the broader Hong Kong market index (.HSI) , opens new tab The outlook for the deal has been clouded further in recent days, with a separate source telling Reuters that Chinese ports operator China Cosco Shipping Corp (COSCO) was also looking to join the consortium to buy the ports business. COSCO is requesting veto rights or equivalent power in the entity that will take over 43 ports from CK Hutchison, Bloomberg News reported this week, citing people familiar with the matter. COSCO did not respond to a request for comment. Responding to Reuters' emailed queries on the deal prospects and possible involvement of COSCO in the consortium, a White House official said: \"As the president said, we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\" The official did not elaborate. The existing consortium would likely allow COSCO into the deal, said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. \"The bigger risk to the deal being consummated, in my opinion, is likely the Trump administration, which is likely to block a deal that would include China,\" said the New Jersey-based analyst who tracks BlackRock. Ballingal Investment Advisors strategist David Blennerhassett, who publishes on the independent online research platform Smartkarma, said the addition of COSCO in the consortium was likely to enrage Trump. \"Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, would be incandescent,\" he said.

Describing Syria's new rulers as barely disguised jihadists, Israel has said it will not let them move forces into southern Syria and vowed to shield the area's Druze community from attack, encouraged by calls from Israel's own Druze minority The U.S. said the fighting would stop soon. \"We have engaged all the parties involved in the clashes in Syria. We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media.

Reuters reporters heard warplanes swoop low over the capital and unleash a series of massive strikes mid-afternoon. Columns of smoke rose from the area near the defence ministry.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli military was working to save the Druze and urged Israeli Druze citizens not to cross the border. The Israeli military said it was working to safely return civilians who had crossed. Israeli Druze man Faez Shkeir said he felt helpless watching the violence in Syria. \"My family is in Syria - my wife is in Syria, my uncles are from Syria, and my family is in Syria, in Sweida, I don't like to see them being killed.

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Agreement expected to be signed Saturday in Doha Key details to end fighting still need to be negotiated U.S. hosting separate talks between Rwanda and Congo July 18 (Reuters) - Congo and the M23 rebel group have agreed to a declaration of principles to end fighting in eastern Congo, a sign of progress after months of talks mediated by Qatar, though key details still need to be negotiated, four sources said on Friday. The declaration, expected to be signed on Saturday in Doha, comes amid heavy U.S. pressure to finalise deals that would bring peace to eastern Congo. This could potentially attract billions of dollars of Western investment to a region rich in tantalum, gold, cobalt, copper, lithium and other minerals. Sign up here. M23, in the latest of a string of uprisings supported by Rwanda, seized Goma, eastern Congo's largest city, in January and went on to make gains across North Kivu and South Kivu provinces. The fighting has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands more this year while escalating the risk of a full-blown regional war. Several of Congo's neighbours already have troops deployed in the volatile region. In March Qatar brokered a surprise meeting between Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame during which they called for an \"immediate and unconditional\" ceasefire. That led to direct talks, also in Doha, between Congo and M23. Congo had previously rejected the idea of holding talks with M23, branding it a terrorist group. In April, both sides pledged to work towards a ceasefire. But sources in both delegations have expressed frustration with the pace of negotiations and the lack of progress on confidence-building measures including the release of M23 members held by Congo and the re-opening of banks in rebel-held territory. It was unclear on Friday how many of those issues have been resolved. There are also bigger questions on possible Rwandan and M23 withdrawals from eastern Congo. An official familiar with the discussions said the declaration of principles, reached after face-to-face meetings as well as shuttle diplomacy by the Qataris, would include an immediate ceasefire and outline \"a commitment to begin formal negotiations on a comprehensive peace agreement in the near future.\" The official said there was also consensus on a mechanism for a permanent ceasefire and a roadmap for restoring state authority in eastern Congo once a peace agreement is signed. An M23 source said the document does not mention any kind of troop withdrawal. \"The American pressure is very strong,\" a Congolese source said on Friday, noting the presence in Doha of Massad Boulos, Trump's senior adviser for Africa. \"But there are still many points unresolved. This is only one step in the discussions.\" TALKS IN WASHINGTON Washington has also hosted talks between Congo and Rwanda. On June 27 the two countries' foreign ministers signed a peace deal and met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. Trump warned of \"very severe penalties, financial and otherwise\" if the deal is violated. Trump also invited Tshisekedi and Kagame to Washington to sign a package of deals that Boulos dubbed the \"Washington Accord\". Speaking to reporters on July 2, Boulos said the Trump administration would \"love\" to hold that meeting at the end of July. But he also said U.S. officials hope to have a deal in Doha finalised by then. Congo, the United Nations and Western powers say Rwanda is supporting M23 by sending troops and arms. A report by a group of United Nations experts obtained by Reuters this month said Kigali exercised command and control over the rebels during their advance. Rwanda has long denied helping M23 and says its forces are acting in self-defence against Congo's army and ethnic Hutu militiamen linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).

Wednesday saw the biggest collapse in British government bond prices since the ill-fated 2022 economic agenda of former prime minister Liz Truss, sparked by investor fright at a tearful appearance by Reeves in parliament. Sign up here. A major rebellion in Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party against welfare reforms - which forced him to gut key parts of the plan - also fed doubts about its ability to cut spending and raised questions about party control. Economists say events this week have increased the chance that Reeves will need to raise tens of billions of pounds in taxes later this year after the government's plan to grow the world's sixth largest economy failed to sufficiently deliver. That would further heap pressure on a party that has consistently trailed Nigel Farage's insurgent, right-wing Reform U.K. in the polls. Economists say the government is caught between unruly lawmakers, a disgruntled electorate and rising borrowing costs that risk getting higher still if investors think the government has lost control of the public finances. \"The economy is still stuck with sluggish growth,\" Michael Saunders, senior adviser to Oxford Economics and a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, told Reuters. \"That means voters are persistently disappointed because they don't feel the living standards are getting any better.\" While more tax hikes are likely coming, he questioned whether the government had the stomach to raise the sums needed to put the public purse back on a sustainable footing - again raising the issue of investor confidence. ECONOMIC STABILITY Reeves and Starmer came to power a year ago, vowing to deliver political and economic stability and sustainable growth after 14 often-chaotic years of Conservative government rule. To win over investors, Reeves set what she described as non-negotiable fiscal rules, and angered businesses and households by raising 40 billion pounds ($55 billion) in taxes at her first budget, the biggest tax increases for three decades. Reeves had said that would be a one-off event to fund much-needed investment in Britain's decaying infrastructure. But economists say the limited headroom she had against that fiscal target has likely been wiped out by the reversal of cuts to the ballooning welfare budget, and a warning of a growth downgrade from the official economic forecaster - requiring higher taxes to keep the fiscal plans on track. \"That ballpark (of repeating her first budget) is very much within the realms of the possible,\" said Ben Zaranko, associate director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank. That prospect means investors are increasingly questioning the credibility of an approach that leaves the government scrambling to find ways to restore fiscal headroom whenever there is bad news on the economy. And the violent market moves on Wednesday encapsulated unease over slipping budgets and the potential for more borrowing, with public sector debt currently just below 100% of GDP. \"Any tax hike needs to be big, and it needs to be clear. Then you can restore the market's confidence,\" said Simon Harvey, senior macroeconomist at Swiss-based hedge fund consultancy LB Macro. \"What we don't need is another round of 15 different measures where you question where the accounting is coming from.\" Harvey said Britain's economy might require a painful reset before it can recover: higher taxes, an economic slowdown and then fast Bank of England rate cuts which will eventually boost growth and the public finances. All of that will cause alarm in Starmer's Downing Street, which has been criticised for its handling of the welfare vote, and its connection with the parliamentary party group. Some Labour lawmakers expressed frustration that his team didn't listen to their concerns on financial cuts for disabled people, and the prime minister admitted he had been distracted by international events before he focused on the welfare vote. But lawmakers, many of whom feel greater loyalty to their voters than to the government, could now lobby for other policy changes, especially an end to a two-child cap that lets parents claim financial support only for their first two children. Starmer has responded by listing his government's achievements to show it is making a difference, citing trade deals, inward investment and more money for schools and hospitals. But the polls have refused to budge and some investors are joining the fray by criticising Britain's leadership. A hedge fund manager who has supported Labour said voters and many businesses did not realise that the government had to rein in its spending, and that Starmer needed to \"lead on how to get out of the predicament\" because the options were likely to \"feel dreadful\".

REUTERS/Yiannis Kourtoglou July 17 (Reuters) - Leaders of ethnically split Cyprus have agreed to continue discussions towards confidence building, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday, in a dispute which has kept NATO partners Greece and Turkey at odds for decades. The Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities will press ahead with attempts to open new crossing points between the two sides and cooperating on solar energy initiatives, Guterres said after hosting the Cypriot leaders at U.N. headquarters in New York. Sign up here. \"It is critical to implement all these initiatives as soon as possible, for the benefit of all Cypriots,\" Guterres said. The two sides had agreed in an encounter with Guterres earlier this year to open four additional crossing points, demine, establish a youth affairs committee, and launch environmental and solar energy projects. There are presently nine crossing points along a 180-km-long (116-mile-long) ceasefire line splitting the two sides. Guterres said there was a \"question of itinerary\" in relation to one of the new checkpoints opening but that there had been important progress on the issue. Cyprus was split more than 50 years ago in a Turkish invasion after a brief Greek-inspired coup, following years of sporadic violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Reunification talks collapsed in mid-2017 and have been in a stalemate since. The Cyprus conflict is a key source of disagreement between NATO allies Greece and Turkey, fiercely defensive of their respective kin on the island.

REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis DHARAMSHALA, India, July 1 (Reuters) - The Dalai Lama will meet 11 senior Buddhist monks on Wednesday morning before delivering a written statement that will \"most probably\" talk about his eventual succession as the spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhists, an official said. Tibetan Buddhists believe that enlightened monks are reborn to continue their spiritual legacy. The 14th Dalai Lama will turn 90 on Sunday and has long been expected to use the occasion to share possible clues on where his successor, a boy or a girl, could be found following his death. Sign up here. Beijing views the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, as a separatist and says it will choose his successor. The Dalai Lama has said his successor will be born outside China and has urged his followers to reject anyone chosen by Beijing. The northern Indian town of Dharamshala, where the Dalai Lama is based with thousands of other Tibetans, has already seen the arrival of the heads of various sects of Buddhism ahead of a Wednesday-Friday religious conference that precedes the birthday celebrations on the weekend. \"All the religious heads are here and they are going to talk to His Holiness, which may relate to reincarnation issues,\" said Tenzin Lekshay, spokesperson for the exiled government in Dharamshala, as mists and rains cloaked the Himalayan hills. On the first day of the conference, more than 100 religious figures including the senior monks will issue a declaration of gratitude to the Dalai Lama and discuss the way ahead, he said. The Dalai Lama will address them in Tibetan in a pre-recorded message but is unlikely to refer to reincarnation in that message, Lekshay said. The issue will \"most probably\" be covered in a written statement to be issued by the Dalai Lama late morning, he said. Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the written statement would refer to his reincarnation. Reporting by Krishna N.

Fleeing his native Tibet in 1959 in the wake of a failed uprising against Chinese rule, the 14th Dalai Lama, along with hundreds of thousands of Tibetans, took shelter in India and has since advocated for a peaceful \"Middle Way\" to seek autonomy and religious freedom for the Tibetan people. Dressed in his traditional yellow and burgundy robe, the Dalai Lama arrived at a temple to smiles and claps from thousands of monks and followers who had gathered on a rainy morning in the small Indian hill town of Dharamshala, where he lives. He waved and greeted them as he walked slowly to the stage with support from monks. \"As far as I am concerned, I have a human life and as humans it is quite natural for us to love and help one another,\" the Dalai Lama said, speaking after a Tibetan cultural performance that included songs for his long life. \"I live my life in the service of other sentient beings,\" he said, flanked on the stage with long-time supporters including western diplomats, Indian federal ministers, Hollywood star Richard Gere and a monk who is expected to lead the search for his successor. In a sign of solidarity, Taiwan's president Lai Ching-te, leaders of Indian states bordering Tibet, and three former U.S. presidents sent greetings to the Dalai Lama, including Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, whose video messages were played during the event. In the preceding week of celebrations, the Dalai Lama had said he would reincarnate as the leader of the faith upon his death and that his non-profit institution, the Gaden Phodrang Trust , had the sole authority to recognise his successor. China has said that the succession will have to be approved by its leaders, and the United States has called on Beijing to cease what it describes as interference in the succession of the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan Buddhist Lamas.

He later clarified that the statement was made in his personal capacity as China warned New Delhi against interfering in its domestic affairs at the expense of bilateral relations. On Sunday, Rijiju said the Dalai Lama was India's \"most honoured guest ... We feel blessed for his presence here in our country\". He said he has always held the view that there was a need to contribute significantly towards the cause of the Tibetan people, and added that, as a devotee, \"We will follow the directions and the guidelines to be issued from the institution of the Dalai Lama.\" Cultural performances were held throughout the morning, including from Bollywood playback singers, while messages from global leaders were read out. \"I join 1.4 billion Indians in extending our warmest wishes to His Holiness the Dalai Lama on his 90th birthday.

    "full_text": "Summary Ten girls and a counselor missing at a summer camp Search for survivors continues amid fears of more flooding Trump plans to visit disaster scene Questions arise over federal response cuts HUNT, Texas, July 6 (Reuters) - The death toll from catastrophic floods in Texas reached at least 78 on Sunday, including 28 children, as the search for girls missing from a summer camp continued and fears of more flooding prompted evacuations of volunteer responders. Larry Leitha, sheriff of Kerr County in Texas Hill Country, said 68 people had died in flooding in his county, the epicenter of the flooding, among them 28 children. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, speaking at a press conference on Sunday afternoon, said another 10 had died elsewhere in Texas and confirmed 41 were missing. Sign up here. President Donald Trump sent his condolences to the victims and said he would probably visit the area on Friday. His administration had been in touch with Abbott, he added. \"It's a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible. So we say, God bless all of the people that have gone through so much, and God bless, God bless the state of Texas,\" he told reporters as he left New Jersey. Among the most devastating impacts of the flooding occurred at Camp Mystic summer camp, a nearly century-old Christian girls camp where 10 Camp Mystic campers and one counselor were still missing, according to Leitha. \"It was nothing short of horrific to see what those young children went through,\" said Abbott, who noted he toured the area on Saturday and pledged to continue efforts to locate the missing. The flooding occurred after the nearby Guadalupe River broke its banks after torrential rain fell in the central Texas area on Friday, the U.S. Independence Day holiday. Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said the destruction killed three people in Burnet County, one in Tom Green County, five in Travis County and one in Williamson County. \"You will see the death toll rise today and tomorrow,\" said Freeman Martin, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, also speaking on Sunday. Officials said on Saturday that more than 850 people had been rescued, including some clinging to trees, after a sudden storm dumped up to 15 inches (38 cm) of rain across the region, about 85 miles (140 km) northwest of San Antonio. Kidd said he was receiving unconfirmed reports of \"an additional wall of water\" flowing down some of the creeks in the Guadalupe Rivershed, as rain continued to fall on soil in the region already saturated from Friday's rains. \"We’re evacuating parts of the river right now because we are worried about another wall of river coming down in those areas,\" he said, referencing volunteers from outside the area seeking to help locate victims. The Federal Emergency Management Agency was activated on Sunday and is deploying resources to first responders in Texas after Trump issued a major disaster declaration, the Department of Homeland Security said. U.S. Coast Guard helicopters and planes were aiding search and rescue efforts. SCALING BACK FEDERAL DISASTER RESPONSE Trump has previously outlined plans to scale back the federal government's role in responding to natural disasters, leaving states to shoulder more of the burden themselves.

REUTERS/Sergio Flores Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Some experts questioned whether cuts to the federal workforce by the Trump administration, including to the agency that oversees the National Weather Service, led to a failure by officials to accurately predict the severity of the floods and issue appropriate warnings ahead of the storm. Trump's administration has overseen thousands of job cuts from the National Weather Service's parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , leaving many weather offices understaffed, former NOAA director Rick Spinrad said. Spinrad said he did not know if those staff cuts factored into the lack of advance warning for the extreme Texas flooding, but that they would inevitably degrade the agency's ability to deliver accurate and timely forecasts. Trump pushed back when asked on Sunday if federal government cuts hobbled the disaster response or left key job vacancies at the National Weather Service under Trump's oversight. \"That water situation, that all is, and that was really the Biden setup,\" he said referencing his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. \"But I wouldn't blame Biden for it, either. I would just say this is 100-year catastrophe.\" He declined to answer a question about FEMA, saying only \"They're busy working, so we'll leave it at that,\" Trump said. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA and NOAA, said a \"moderate\" flood watch issued on Thursday by the National Weather Service had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall and said the Trump administration was working to upgrade the system. Joaquin Castro, a Democratic U.S. congressman from Texas, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" program that fewer personnel at the weather service could be dangerous. \"When you have flash flooding, there's a risk that if you don't have the personnel ... to do that analysis, do the predictions in the best way, it could lead to tragedy,\" Castro said. 'COMPLETE DEVASTATION' Katharine Somerville, a counselor on the Cypress Lake side of Camp Mystic, on higher ground than the Guadalupe River side, said her 13-year-old campers were scared as their cabins sustained damage and lost power in the middle of the night. \"Our cabins at the tippity top of hills were completely flooded with water. I mean, y'all have seen the complete devastation, we never even imagined that this could happen,\" Somerville said in an interview on Fox News on Sunday. Somerville said the campers in her care were put on military trucks and evacuated, and that all were safe. The disaster unfolded rapidly on Friday morning as heavier-than-forecast rain drove river waters rapidly to as high as 29 feet (9 meters). A day after the disaster struck, the summer camp, where 700 girls were in residence at the time of the flooding, was a scene of devastation. Inside one cabin, mud lines indicating how high the water had risen were at least six feet (1.83 m) from the floor. Bed frames, mattresses and personal belongings caked with mud were scattered inside. Some buildings had broken windows, one had a missing wall.

REUTERS/Rebecca Noble/File Photo Summary Companies Front-runner is daughter of representative who died in March 25-year-old rival had been gaining attention Party seeks to win over both progressives and moderates WASHINGTON, July 15 Reuters) - Establishment-backed Democrat Adelita Grijalva was set to win a primary to fill the U.S. House of Representatives seat in Arizona vacated by her late father, according to several media projections late on Tuesday. Grijalva, a 54-year-old former county board supervisor, held off a late, surging challenge from Deja Foxx, a 25-year-old rival who was backed by progressives seeking generational changes within the Democratic Party. Sign up here. Grijalva is now favored to win the September 23 general election to replace Representative Raul Grijalva, her father who died in March, in Arizona's 7th Congressional District that is heavily Democratic and stretches along the U.S.-Mexico border, including parts of Tucson. If she prevails in September's general election, Grijalva will become the first Latina to be elected to an Arizona U.S. House seat. She would fill out the two-year term her father won in last November's election. Altogether, he served for over 22 years in the House and earned a reputation as a protector of public lands and an advocate for immigration reforms. Unofficial returns posted by the Arizona secretary of state's office had Grijalva leading Foxx by a solid 62%-20.6%. With Democrats' losses in last year's presidential and congressional elections weighing heavily on the party nationwide, it has struggled over how best to appeal to young progressives while luring back working-class voters who shifted toward the Republican Party. Grijalva racked up notable backers spanning the party divide. They include environmental groups, labor unions and lawmakers who range from progressive luminaries such as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to the moderate Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio. But Foxx, half Grijalva's age and emphasizing her youth, gained attention in what some party activists hoped would be a shock victory for progressives, much like Zohran Mamdani's in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary last month. Foxx won the endorsement of David Hogg, a survivor of a 2018 Florida school shooting who held a high position within the Democratic National Committee until he ruffled establishment feathers by threatening to help finance challengers to Democratic incumbents he deemed insufficiently progressive. A more moderate former Arizona state representative, Daniel Hernandez Jr., also ran for the Democratic nomination along with two other Democratic candidates. Raul Grijalva won re-election in November, easily beating his Republican opponent by about 27 percentage points. Next year's midterm elections give Democrats the opportunity to capture a majority in the House, which currently is narrowly controlled by Republicans 220-212. Republicans also held a primary election for Grijalva's seat on Tuesday. Daniel Francis Sr., who has worked in the construction industry, was leading two challengers, according to early returns.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File photo Summary Companies Dollar firms against major peers Fed Chair Powell's future in focus Japan's political shift weighs on yen NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded broadly on Thursday following a turbulent session on Wednesday when U.S. President Donald Trump denied reports that he was planning to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The dollar has rallied this month in what analysts say is largely consolidation following a sharp selloff for most of this year. The dollar index remains down 9% year-to-date. Rising Treasury yields this month are supporting the dollar’s rebound. Sign up here. “After having a historic sell-off in the first half, the dollar has begun the second half on firmer footing. It looks like mostly short covering backed by these firmer U.S. interest rates,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York. The dollar extended gains on Thursday after data showed U.S. retail sales rebounded more than expected in June, while the number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits fell last week However, the greenback quickly fell back to trade close to where it was before the data, which Chandler said shows “the lack of near-term conviction.” A column chart titled \"Monthly change in US core retail sales\" that tracks the metric over the last year. Investors are weighing multiple factors that could influence market direction, including the economic impact of Trump’s tariff policies, the U.S. fiscal and debt outlook, and the Fed’s independence. The dollar tumbled on Wednesday on reports that Trump was planning to fire Powell soon, before paring losses when Trump denied the news . Trump has said repeatedly that interest rates should be at 1% or lower. Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, seen as a potential successor to Powell, said on Thursday there needs to be a new accord between the Treasury Department and the U.S. central bank, referencing a 1951 pact that separated federal debt management from monetary policy. The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, was last up 0.41% on the day at 98.75, with the euro down 0.45% at $1.1582. The single currency earlier reached $1.1555, the lowest level since June 23. In other currencies, sterling weakened after data showed British pay growth slowing in May and employee numbers dropping further last month. The British pound was last down 0.1% at $1.3405. Concerns also mounted over a pivotal election in Japan and a still elusive trade deal with the U.S. to avoid a punishing rise in tariffs. Polls showed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition was in danger of losing its majority in the upper house. Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, held talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on tariffs on Thursday, as Tokyo races to avert a 25% levy that will be imposed unless a deal is clinched by an August 1 deadline. The yen weakened 0.58% against the greenback to 148.73 per dollar after touching its weakest level since April 3 in the previous session . The Australian dollar slid after jobs data badly missed forecasts and unemployment hit highs not seen since late 2021. The Aussie was last down 0.64% versus the greenback at $0.6484.

Joby Aviation conducted the first test flight of its fully-electric air taxi in the emirate this week, a major milestone in the city's efforts to integrate airborne transport into existing mobility networks as early as next year. Sign up here. Joby hopes its air-taxis will ease pressure on existing ground transportation and offer travelers a faster alternative as Dubai faces increasing congestion. \"We want to change the way people commute,\" Anthony Khoury, Joby's UAE General Manager, said. A journey from Dubai's main airport DXB to Palm Jumeirah aboard the Joby Aerial Taxi will take roughly twelve minutes, the company predicts, as opposed to 45 minutes by car. While Joby's long-term ambition is to make its aerial taxis \"affordable for everybody to use,\" Khoury says, they acknowledge early pricing will likely target higher-income travelers. \"As with any novel technology, early days might be a bit more premium.\" The demonstration flight was held on Monday at an isolated desert site southeast of Dubai’s downtown and was designed to emulate a typical aerial taxi journey, according to Joby Aviation officials. In a ceremony attended by senior government officials, transport executives and company representatives, the experimental aircraft executed a vertical takeoff, flew for several miles, and then returned for a vertical landing.

Fully electric, with zero operating emissions, Joby's air-taxi is designed to be both eco-friendly and quiet enough for commercial use in dense urban areas. “It will be flying in the city, next to residential areas, and hopefully people will barely notice it,” Khoury said. While eVTOLs such as Joby's have been hailed as the future of urban air the industry still faces major hurdles -- including securing regulatory approval and developing sufficient vertiport infrastructure. Morgan Stanley downgraded Joby's stock price target from $10 to $7 in April, flagging near-term execution risks and broader aerospace industry concerns, including tariffs and supply-chain issues. Joby is currently trading at $10.55. In early 2024, Joby signed a contract with Dubai's Roads and Transit Authority that awarded the company exclusive rights to operate aerial taxis in the city for the next six years. The company plans to inaugurate the emirate’s commercial air-taxi service in 2026, with four initial vertiports located at Dubai International Airport (DXB), Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Downtown and Dubai Marina. “In aviation, you don’t see transformations like this,” said Didier Papadopoulos, Joby’s President of Original Equipment Manufacturing. “Every once in a while, you have this propulsive move into the future.

The ECB has halved its key rate to 2% since June 2024 but its moderately sanguine tone on Thursday was seen as a signal it was not in any hurry to cut again.

The central bank attributed the slimmer deficit to the increase in remittances from Egyptians working abroad, as well as a rise in the services surplus due to higher tourism revenue. Sign up here. Oil exports declined to $1.2 billion, from $1.4 in the year earlier, while imports of oil products rose to $4.8 from $3.4 billion. Egypt has sought to import more fuel oil and liquefied natural gas this year to meet its power demands after disruptions to gas supply led to blackouts over the last two years. Concerns over supplies increased after the pipeline supply of natural gas from Israel to Egypt decreased during Israel’s air war with Iran last month. Revenues from the Suez Canal, declined to $0.8 billion in the third quarter of the country’s financial year, from $1 billion the same time a year ago, as Yemeni Houthis' attacks on ships in the Red Sea continued to cause disruption. The Iran-aligned group says it attacks ships linked to Israel in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Meanwhile, Egypt’s tourism revenues reached $3.8 billion, compared to $3.1 billion in the same period in 2023/24. Remittances from Egyptians working abroad increased to $9.3 billion, from $5.1 billion. The increase in remittances has helped to reduce the wider trade deficit. Foreign direct investment hit $3.8 billion, compared to $18.2 billion in the same quarter a year before. Egypt has suffered an economic crisis exacerbated by a foreign currency shortage, which forced it to undergo economic reforms under an $8 billion IMF programme that included allowing its pound to depreciate sharply last year.

The release was part of a coordinated prisoner exchange, with 10 Americans held in Venezuela returned to the United States, officials from all three countries said. Sign up here. In a post on X, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the Americans were en route to El Salvador from where they would continue \"their journey home,\" while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the release of \"ten Americans who were detained in Venezuela.\" He thanked Bukele for his help in securing the agreement. Venezuela's government said 252 Venezuelans held in El Salvador had been freed. President Nicolas Maduro celebrated the arrival of two airplanes carrying them near Caracas on Friday evening. The Venezuelans were sent to El Salvador from the United States in March after U.S. President Donald Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without going through normal immigration procedures. They were held in El Salvador's notorious CECOT maximum security prison. The deportations drew fierce criticism from human rights groups and a legal battle with the Trump administration over allegations that due process was not followed. Family members of many of the Venezuelans and their lawyers deny they had gang ties, and say they were not given a chance to contest the Trump administration's allegations in court. \"I can't believe it,\" said Angie Rios, the U.S. citizen wife of Venezuelan CECOT detainee Jesus Rios after seeing Bukele's X post about the release. \"I have chills all over my body.\" Some family members of Venezuelan CECOT prisoners told Reuters they expected to greet their loved ones from a distance before the men are processed by Venezuelan authorities.

A press representative said the photo was taken in Caracas. A later photo showed the men onboard a plane. Senior U.S. officials also said 80 domestic political prisoners in Venezuela would be freed, although the Venezuelan government referred only to \"alternative\" detention measures in its statement. Former opposition governor and politician Williams Davila, arrested in August of last year, was released on Friday, said Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, while an NGO for political prisoners published a list of 14 others they said had been released. Separately, Venezuela hailed the return of seven migrant children who had been separated from their parents in the United States. The children were among another batch of Venezuelans who returned from the U.S. on a regular deportation flight. Venezuela's government has always decried the detention of its citizens as a violation of human rights and international law. But the government's critics say the country holds activists and opposition figures in similar conditions in Venezuela. The U.S. Alien Enemies Act is best known for being used to intern and deport people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War Two. Trump's use of the act kicked off a major legal standoff in the U.S. that tested the balance of power between the president and the judiciary, a co-equal branch of government to the executive. Much of the legal battle focused on whether the Trump administration had violated a court order by declining to turn around the planes carrying the Venezuelans to El Salvador, despite a judge's directive to halt the deportations. The Supreme Court in May said the Trump administration must give \"constitutionally adequate notice\" before using the Alien Enemies Act to bypass standard immigration processes. The high court also ruled that people subjected to the law are entitled to habeas petitions to request their release, limiting its application.

The proposal to partially suspend Israel's participation in the Horizon Europe programme needs approval from a qualified majority of EU countries to take effect - at least 15 of the EU's 27 members, representing at least 65% of its population. The European Commission said in a statement that the proposal comes as a reaction to a review of Israel's compliance with the human rights clause of an agreement governing its relations with the EU. The bloc's diplomatic service said in June that there were indications that Israel had breached its obligations under the terms of the pact. \"While Israel has announced a daily humanitarian pause in Gaza fighting and has met some of its commitments under the common understanding on humanitarian aid and access, the situation remains severe,\" the Commission said on Monday. The U.N.'s World Food Programme has said that almost 470,000 people in Gaza are enduring famine-like conditions, with 90,000 women and children in need of specialist nutrition treatments. The Israeli government has rejected international criticism of its policies in the enclave. Israel's foreign ministry said in a post on social media platform X on Monday that the Commission's move was \"mistaken, regrettable, and unjustified\" and that it hoped EU member countries would not adopt the proposal. Israel has been participating in the EU's research programs since 1996, taking part in thousands of joint projects over the past decades. The Commission said the proposal would impact the participation of Israeli entities in the bloc's European Innovation Council Accelerator \"which targets start-ups and small businesses with disruptive innovations and emerging technologies that have potential dual-use applications, such as in cybersecurity, drones, and artificial intelligence\". It did not say how much funding would be affected by the proposed freeze.

    "full_text": "BRUSSELS, July 10 (Reuters) - The European Union's diplomatic service on Thursday presented 10 options for political action against Israel after it found \"indications\" last month that Israel breached human rights obligations under a pact governing its ties with the bloc. In a document prepared for EU member countries and seen by Reuters, the options included major steps such as suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement - which includes trade relations - and more minor actions such as suspending technical projects. Sign up here. Prior to last month's report, EU members had voiced increasing concern about Israel's treatment of Palestinians in its war against Hamas militants in Gaza, and expressed alarm about restrictions on aid entering the enclave. Most of the measures presented on Thursday would require the approval of all the EU's 27 member countries or a majority of them. Diplomats say it is unclear whether there is a willingness among enough member states for any of the options to be taken forward. EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the options at a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday. So far, there has been no sign that many EU countries would favour the more severe measures outlined in the options paper. But last month's report and the follow-up paper reflect a desire to at least signal widespread EU frustration with the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Thursday that Israel had agreed to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including increasing trucks for aid and opening crossing points and certain aid routes. Among the options in the paper are the full or partial suspension of the Association Agreement. A partial suspension could cover preferential trade treatment or political dialogue with Israel, the document says. The EU could also suspend Israel's participation in the Erasmus+ student exchange or Horizon academic research programmes, according to the document. In addition, the paper lists options that could be pursued outside the scope of the Association Agreement, such as imposing sanctions on Israeli ministers over human rights abuses, or an arms embargo on weapons that could be used in Gaza. The EU could halt visa-free travel for Israelis to the EU or ban imports from Israeli settlements on Palestinian territories - or individual EU countries could decide to implement such a ban, the document says. Israel has insisted its actions in Gaza are lawful and necessary to crush Hamas, following the militants' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. An Israeli official dismissed last month's EU report as one-sided saying it \"exemplifies the double standards the EU uses towards Israel\".

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Euro saw biggest first half gains in its history Speculative long euro bets at $18.4 billion ahead of weekend Trade deal removes uncertainty for dollar as well as euro Fears for dollar at start of year unrealised LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - Euro bulls are facing the first big test of their conviction in the form of the European Union's U.S. trade deal , which has cast doubt on the durability of one of 2025's most popular trades. The euro, which hit a four-year high of $1.1830 earlier this month, was last at $1.1554 following its biggest two-day drop since April on Tuesday , after the EU agreed to a 15% tariff on its U.S. exports - half the rate President Donald Trump had previously threatened, but well above the roughly 1.5-2% rate prior to his return to the White House. Sign up here. While it inched higher on Wednesday, it was set for its first monthly drop this year, down nearly 2% in July. But both of those factors are challenged by the agreement: The European economy will still take a hit from the tariffs, while deals the U.S. has agreed with the EU and other partners have reduced fears about a major slowdown there. \"The long euro trade is undoubtedly facing a reality check this week,\" said Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management. \"Monday’s sharp drop in euro/dollar felt like more than just a reaction to headlines — it exposed how stretched positioning had become in one of the market’s most consensus views.\" \"What stood out wasn’t just the magnitude of the move, but the lack of support on the way down.\" Going into the weekend, speculators were sitting on a bullish bet on euro futures worth $18.4 billion , the largest since December 2023, according to weekly data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That position has been building since last December. At the start of the year speculators held one of their largest bearish positions in the euro in almost five years. RELATIVE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE The euro also weakened sharply against other currencies on Monday, dropping 0.8% on the pound and 0.7% on the Japanese yen, again after recent gains. But the bulk of its moves, both up this year, and down this week, have been against the dollar. In trade-weighted terms, the euro is only up about 5% this year. And its gains on the U.S. currency were already slowing as initial pessimism towards the U.S. at the start of the year faded thanks to strong economic data and earnings, reinforced by the flurry of trade deals with Japan and the EU, and ongoing negotiations with China. \"The (U.S.-EU) trade deal has removed a potential headwind (for the euro) but it has also removed an uncertainty for the dollar too, which leaves the euro looking a little overvalued,\" said Michael Metcalfe, head of macro strategy at State Street. But the end of the euro's rally on the dollar is not yet a done deal. \"The vast majority of people - ourselves included - think that this is just a correction to an underlying bull trend in euro/dollar,\" said Chris Turner, global head of research at ING. He said the biggest test would be on the dollar side of the currency pair, as investors had now digested the impact of the trade deal on Europe. Therefore, the focus turns to this week's economic data, including U.S. jobs and inflation and European economic growth, and Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting. The Fed is likely to keep U.S. interest rates steady, which may generate more angry rhetoric from Trump who has been pushing for big cuts. This matters for the dollar. The currency fell sharply earlier this month, including against the euro, when Trump appeared close to trying to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell. And even setting aside the trade deal, there are reasons to be optimistic about Europe, particularly given Germany's spending plans. \"We haven't changed our view of upside risks to growth in Europe,\" said Russel Matthews, portfolio manager at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, who has been neutral on currencies as he balanced \"the long term structural bias for a weakening dollar\" with \"the more positive short-term technical picture.\" \"The new narrative that the U.S. has got a better deal has tarnished, to some extent, the upside potential from developments in the last three to six months in Europe, but it hasn't necessarily changed that dynamic.\" Reporting by Alun John, Nell Mackenzie and Yoruk Bahceli in London, additional reporting by Lucy Raitano, editing by Amanda Cooper and Hugh Lawson Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab"

A Justice Department spokesperson on Wednesday confirmed the probes but declined to provide further details. Sign up here. Fox News, citing unnamed sources, first reported on Tuesday that the two men were being investigated for alleged wrongdoing during probes of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. \"I know nothing about this reported investigation or referral to the DOJ, other than what I've read in these press reports, these leaks, which are not really supposed to happen if there is an investigation going on,\" Brennan said in an interview with MSNBC in his first public comments on the probes. Brennan said no one from the Justice Department, FBI or CIA had reached out to him. \"I think this is unfortunately a very sad and tragic example of the continued politicization of the intelligence community, of the national security process,\" Brennan said, adding that the investigation \"clearly is just politically based.\" Comey has not commented on the investigations. Reports of the investigations come as the Justice Department and FBI face blowback from some Trump supporters after concluding that there was no evidence to support a number of long-held conspiracy theories about the death of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged clientele. Brennan headed the CIA when U.S. intelligence assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to sway the 2016 election vote in Trump's favor over his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, through an online disinformation campaign. That finding was confirmed by a bipartisan report released in August 2018 by the Senate intelligence committee whose acting chairman was Marco Rubio, now Trump’s secretary of state. It did not find any evidence of a coordinated scheme between Russia and Trump’s campaign. The roles played by Brennan and Comey in handling the intelligence community report on Russia’s 2016 election interference were investigated during Trump’s first term by Special Counsel John Durham, who found no criminal wrongdoing by either man. Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Brennan and Comey for their roles in the investigations into Russian interference, said on Wednesday that he knew nothing about the probes \"other than what I read today.\" \"I think they're very dishonest people, I think they are crooked as hell, and maybe they have to pay a price for that,\" Trump told reporters. \"Whatever happens, happens.\" Reporting by Christian Martinez Additional reporting by Sarah N.

Sign up here. An audit by the Transportation Department Office of Inspector General said FAA safety inspectors have been unable to fully resolve issues relating to SkyWest's remote return-to-service maintenance practices for more than four years. Under this practice introduced in 2018, centrally located maintenance controllers at SkyWest's headquarters in Utah oversee SkyWest mechanics or contract mechanics performing maintenance at the aircraft's location, the report said. The audit said FAA inspectors found that SkyWest was \"inappropriately deferring maintenance for minimum equipment list items, dispatching aircraft for flights without required inspections, and using pilots to perform maintenance tasks not approved in SkyWest’s maintenance manuals.\" SkyWest said it was committed to maintaining the highest standards of safety and compliance across all aspects of its operations. It said it had also taken numerous actions to help the FAA \"identify and resolve any issues in either of our processes to better support SkyWest’s safety efforts.\" Since 2021, the FAA has been working to resolve 32 issues at SkyWest. The report said at the time of the inspector general's analysis, the FAA had resolved 26 issues but noncompliance persisted with SkyWest’s remote return-to-service maintenance practices. Even though several FAA inspectors identified similar systemic hazard issues, the agency did not initiate a systemic risk review until two years after issues were found. The report said FAA inspectors were frustrated their efforts were being delayed \"and concerned that the airline’s remote maintenance practices could contribute to an accident.\" The FAA said it agreed with six of the seven recommendations and planned to implement them by July 2026. The FAA said it also agreed delays in submissions can hinder safety assessments. In March 2020, an accident in New York revealed pilots were performing unauthorized maintenance procedures, the report said. In 2023, remote return-to-service maintenance actions may have resulted in flights that did not meet FAA safety requirements, it added. The report cited an aircraft released for flight without a required operational altimeter and another flight that included an improperly deferred fuel fault advisory message.

REUTERS/Rogan Ward Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Reuters) - (This July 16 factbox has been corrected to show the last communique was October 2024, not July 2024, in the last paragraph) Group of 20 finance officials meet in South Africa from Thursday amid trade tensions, a global economic slowdown and Washington's threat to withdraw from multilateral organisations. President Cyril Ramaphosa has sought to leverage Africa's first G20 presidency to promote an African agenda, with topics including the high cost of capital and climate change. Sign up here. Here are the key issues to be discussed: DEBT STRESS Nearly two dozen countries in Africa are already in or at high risk of debt distress, the International Monetary Fund said. Debt-servicing costs crowd out spending on services like infrastructure development, health and education. Launched in late 2020, the G20 Common Framework is a platform aimed at speeding up and simplifying the process of getting overstretched countries back on their feet. But progress has been slow. Making the platform more efficient is one target for South Africa. Ramaphosa launched an Africa Expert Panel in March whose role is to galvanise efforts, chief among them debt relief. Panel chair Trevor Manuel told Reuters it had already begun to make detailed recommendations on improving the framework. \"One of the reforms is that the opportunities in the Common Framework should be available to all middle-income countries as well,\" said Manuel. FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT With aid and development-finance cuts and a pivot by wealthy countries to defence spending, traditional funding sources for developing nations have become scarcer. South Africa is looking to shore up favourable finance for poorer nations. It wants to strengthen and improve the role of multilateral development banks in financing for development. Washington, meanwhile, could potentially withdraw from more global institutions - including these banks. Some analysts believe Washington's withdrawal from multilateralism could leave a space for China to occupy, but it is unclear if Beijing aims to do that. Lending to Africa from China has slowed to a trickle leaving an $80 billion financing gap. Meanwhile, U.S. and European grants - accounting for 25% of the region's external financing - face cuts as Washington suspends foreign aid and European capitals redirect funds toward defence. JUST ENERGY TRANSITION President Donald Trump's administration has withdrawn from the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) - a key focus for South Africa that is designed to help developing countries transition away from coal to cleaner energy. Launched in 2021, JETPs aim to funnel money from governments, multilateral lenders and the private sector to renewable energy projects in a way that benefits local communities. On Monday, the G20's financial stability watchdog said it had developed a new plan to tackle climate risks but it had paused further policy work in light of the U.S. retreat from climate action. Mobilising funding for climate disasters affecting the Global South was a key agenda item for South Africa's presidency. TRADE Trump's tariff threats have disrupted the global economy and the response will dominate the agenda even as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent skips the gathering. U.S. plans for tariffs on Canada, Europe and Mexico as well as threats to impose further levies on BRICS member countries including China, India, Russia, Brazil and G20 host South Africa, further heighten tensions between the world's largest economy and other G20 nations. COMMUNIQUE Director General of Treasury Duncan Pieterse said in a statement on Monday that he hoped to issue the first Communique under the South African G20 presidency at the end of the meetings. The G20 was last able to take a mutually agreed stance to issue a Communique in October 2024.

The Truce talks have been revived following last month's 12-day Israeli air war against its arch-foe Iran, which backs Hamas. The U.S.- backed proposal for a 60-day ceasefire envisages a phased release of hostages, Israeli troop withdrawals from parts of Gaza and discussions on ending the war entirely. Ending the war has been the main sticking point in past rounds of talks, with Hamas demanding a full end to the conflict in return for releasing all hostages, and Israel insisting it would fight on until Hamas is dismantled. Some of Netanyahu's hardline coalition partners oppose ending the fighting. But, with Israelis having become increasingly weary of the 21-month-old war, his government is expected to back a ceasefire. The war was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Around 20 of the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza are believed to be still alive. Israel's retaliatory military campaign against Hamas has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health authorities, led to a hunger crisis, displaced nearly all the population and left most of the territory in ruins.

    "full_text": "French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou attends a news conference to present a major public finance recovery plan, outlining his first budgetary orientations for 2026, in Paris, France, July 15, 2025. REUTERS/Abdul Saboor Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab PARIS, July 15 (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou on Tuesday announced a plan to steady France's creaking public finances, outlining 43.8 billion euros ($50.88 billion) in deficit reduction measures in 2026, and proposing cutting two bank holidays to spur growth. Below is a factbox on the key measures: Sign up here. WHY ARE FRANCE'S FINANCES SO BAD? France saw its budget deficit hit 5.8% of gross domestic product last year, nearly double the official EU limit of 3% of GDP, as a political crisis left four successive governments paralysed and incapable of tackling an unexpected drop in tax income and surge in spending for a second year. Bayrou, a long-time debt hawk who is already facing an uprising from opposition lawmakers over his plan to push unpleasant spending cuts through a deeply divided parliament, said France had become \"addicted\" to public cash, and needed to get its house in order. France faces credit ratings downgrades and higher interest payment costs if it cannot steady the ship. WHAT IS BAYROU'S PLAN? The government has targeted a budget deficit of 4.6% in 2026, and aims to bring it down to 3% in 2029. The plan will be two-pronged, focused on debt reduction and boosting industrial growth and job creation. KEY POINTS OF THE DEFICIT-REDUCTION PLAN - A freeze on state and local spending, excluding defence. - Cutting 3,000 civil service jobs with no replacement of one in three retirees from 2027. - Merging or closing government agencies, trimming 1,000–1,500 posts. - A 5 billion euro cap on health spending growth via higher co‑pays, limiting free drug schemes, efficiency gains and sick‑leave reforms. - 7.1 billion euros to be saved by freezing social benefits, civil servants' wages and income tax brackets next year at 2025 levels. - 9.9 billion euros to be saved via a crackdown on fraud, a curbing of tax loopholes, a restructuring of a tax break for pensioners, an added solidarity surcharge for high earners, and a new parcel tax. PROPOSED MEASURES TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY - Cut two national public holidays - perhaps Easter Monday or May 8 - to increase annual working days. - Reform employment system to provide faster job placement and streamlined hiring rules. - Introduce a unified social allowance to incentivise work. - Reform unemployment insurance and pension schemes, with special provisions for mothers and strenuous jobs. - Cut red tape, with a plan to offer firms the chance to opt for simplified regulation in exchange for fewer public grants and a bill later in the year that would allow the fast-tracking industrial site authorisations. - Stimulate industrial competitiveness by extending nuclear plants to 50–60 years and restarting investments in hydroelectric power. - France will audit underperforming sectors to identify opportunities for local production, while strategic support will be directed toward high-performing industries through strengthened public-private coordination. - Invest in future-facing industries, particularly in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. - Reforms of public procurement with France advocating for a \"European preference\" in EU tendering rules to prioritize domestic and continental suppliers.

    "full_text": "Summary Bayrou's proposal aims to reduce deficit Plan echoes Raffarin's failed 2003 holiday cut Faces opposition from far-right and leftist parties Public largely rejects holiday cuts, poll shows PARIS, July 16 (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou wants to scrap two public holidays to put France's finances back on track. It's a brave move: The last French leader to try something similar soon found himself out of a job. Bayrou, a long-time debt hawk who is fighting for his political survival, made the headline-grabbing proposal on Tuesday , when he outlined a series of deficit-reduction measures worth 43.8 billion euros ($50.88 billion) next year aimed at lowering France's debt. Sign up here. \"The entire nation must work more - to produce, to increase overall national activity throughout the year, and to improve France's situation,\" Bayrou said. \"That's why I propose the removal of two public holidays.\" His idea is not without precedent. In 2003, just months after a heatwave that killed nearly 15,000 people, then-Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin announced a plan to scrap the Pentecost Monday holiday and replace it with a \"day of solidarity.\" Pitched as a form of civic duty to finance aid for the elderly who had been disproportionably affected by the heatwave, employees would work for free while employers would also contribute. The measure, rolled out in 2005, was a disaster. Some offices and schools shut; others remained open. Some workers got paid; others didn't. Strikes and protests soon followed. \"It has become a social and political mess,\" newspaper Le Monde wrote in an editorial at the time. Two weeks later, the day after voters rejected a referendum on the European Union constitution, Raffarin resigned. BAYROU'S UNCERTAIN FUTURE Bayrou, who has survived eight attempts to topple him since taking office last December, is certain to face more no-confidence votes in a few months when budget talks gather momentum. His fate now rests largely in the hands of the far-right National Rally (RN), France's largest parliamentary party, which can topple him if its lawmakers team up with the left. \"If Francois Bayrou does not change his plans, we'll vote for a motion of no-confidence against him,\" RN party chief Marine Le Pen said on Tuesday, joining leftist party chiefs who also signalled their willingness to unseat Bayrou.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes [1/3] French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou gestures as he speaks during a conference to outline the priorities for the public finances in a first step towards preparing the next budget, in Paris, France, April 15, 2025. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Jean-Daniel Levy, from pollster Harris Interactive, told Reuters that while most supported Bayrou's deficit-reduction efforts, 70% of respondents to their snap poll rejected the scrapping of two public holidays, and 61% rejected Bayrou's proposed welfare spending freeze. \"I think everyone agrees we need to make an effort — but there are efforts, and then there are efforts,\" said Jean Claude Vie, 85, as he walked the streets of Paris. \"Is he making any effort himself?\" he asked of Bayrou, saying the 74-year-old would \"be better off retiring than holding onto a job that could go to someone younger.\" Ditching the Pentecost holiday was an easier sell in 2003, Levy said, as many French wanted to give back after the killer heatwave. Bayrou, however, has no such levers to pull. \"It's perceived as a double punishment,\" Levy said. \"Working more without earning more, and losing moments of rest.\" Speaking on TF1 about the public holidays, Labour Minister Astrid Panosyan-Bouvet said that in \"exchange\" for the additional working days, a \"contribution\" would be requested from businesses, without giving more details. OPPOSITION SENSES AN OPPORTUNITY Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's young protege and the RN's possible candidate in the 2027 presidential vote, zeroed in on Bayrou's proposal to abolish holidays, calling it \"a direct attack on our history, our roots, and the France of workers.\" Leaders on the left were equally displeased. Sophie Binet, who leads the CGT union, criticised the plan to scrap the May 8 holiday, which commemorates the end of World War Two, questioning the nixing of a day celebrating \"the victory over Nazism, just as the far right stands at the gates of power.\" Not all were outraged. In an op-ed in Le Monde, economist Charles Wyplosz said Bayrou's \"budget proposal is courageous and, overall, rather well-conceived.\" Scrapping two public holidays would increase revenues to the tune of 4 billion euros, he estimated. Despite being diluted by lawmakers in 2008, Raffarin's \"day of solidarity\" endures, widely derided as a \"ghost holiday\" that continues to cause confusion among workers and employers.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab ZUGSPITZE, Germany, July 18 (Reuters) - Germany's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt and five European counterparts agreed on a set of goals on Friday to tighten asylum rules in the bloc, including allowing deportations to Afghanistan and Syria. The meeting at Germany's highest peak, the Zugspitze, follows Berlin's decision in May to reject asylum seekers at the border, a policy it said was coordinated with neighbouring countries but drew significant criticism. Sign up here. It comes almost exactly a decade after former German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the country's borders to nearly a million refugees fleeing war and persecution, a landmark decision that reshaped European politics. Dobrindt met counterparts from France, Poland, Austria, the Czech Republic and Denmark, as well as EU Home Affairs Commissioner Magnus Brunner. The agreed asylum policy goals, which require approval from Brussels, include removing legislative obstacles to transferring rejected asylum seekers to secure centres outside the EU and enabling asylum procedures in third countries. Germany's new government has already placed curbs on migration including suspending family reunification and resettlement programmes, as it seeks to regain support from voters drawn to the far-right Alternative for Germany, which made historic gains in February's federal election. On Friday Germany deported 81 Afghan men to Afghanistan. \"We are all concerned that the overburdening of our countries by illegal migration is also contributing massively to the polarization of society. We want to push back this polarization,\" Dobrindt said. Deportations to countries such as Afghanistan and Syria should be reinstated as standard practice, with citizens from countries failing to cooperate on deportations to face visa restrictions, a joint declaration said. Trade, and development aid will also be used as leverage to boost returns and strengthen migration cooperation, the document said, pressing for increasing deployment of drones and more EU funding for border infrastructure and personnel. The countries agreed to combat smugglers and work to dismantle human trafficking networks. Asylum seekers who have already been granted protection in another EU country will be quickly rejected if they claim asylum elsewhere in the bloc. \"Once we seal the external border, there will be no need for internal border controls,\" Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said. Siemoniak said he discussed the border controls Germany introduced unilaterally at its border with Dobrindt, adding that Poland is ready to waive the controls at its border once Germany does the same.

REUTERS/Annegret Hilse/File Photo BERLIN, July 8 (Reuters) - A German court ruled on Tuesday that the government is obliged to issue visas to Afghan nationals and their family members who were accepted into a humanitarian admissions programme that the new centre-right coalition intends to shut down. A foreign ministry official said the government was reviewing the decision, which is not yet legally binding. Sign up here. After the hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 by Western allies, Germany established several programmes to resettle local staff as well as particularly vulnerable Afghans. Since May 2021, Germany has admitted about 36,500 vulnerable Afghans including former local staff by various pathways. Some 2,400 Afghans approved for admission are waiting in Pakistan to travel to Germany without a clear idea of when, as the programme has been suspended pending a government review, the foreign ministry in Berlin said this month. The court decision, in response to an urgent appeal by an Afghan woman and her family, ruled that the government was legally bound to honour its \"irrevocable\" commitment to them. \"The applicants assert that they are entitled to a visa and can no longer remain in Pakistan. They face deportation to Afghanistan, where they fear for their lives,\" it said. However, the government is within its rights to end the programme for Afghans and refrain from issuing any new admission commitments going forward, according to the court in Berlin. NGOs have said that an additional 17,000 Afghans are in the early stages of selection and application under the now-dormant scheme. The court's decision can be appealed. Germany's new government has pledged a tougher stance on migration after several high-profile attacks and the rise of the far right made it a pivotal issue in February elections. As a part of that push, conservative Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has vowed to halt refugee admission programmes and to deport people to Afghanistan and Syria.

France's decision to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September also drew condemnation from Israel and the United States, amid the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas. Germany's stance on Israel is strongly influenced by what it regards as a special responsibility to atone for the Nazi Holocaust against European Jews in which six million were killed during Hitler's 1933-45 regime. French President Emmanuel Macron announced the decision late Thursday, shortly before British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he would hold an emergency call with France and Germany on the humanitarian situation in Gaza on Friday. Britain's immediate priority is alleviating suffering in Gaza and securing a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a cabinet minister said on Friday, even as Starmer came under growing pressure to recognise a Palestinian state. Italy's foreign minister said on Friday that recognition of a Palestinian state must occur simultaneously with the recognition of Israel by the new entity. \"A Palestinian state that does not recognise Israel means that the problem will not be resolved,\" Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told a meeting of his conservative Forza Italia party. France's move, though symbolic, underlined Israel's increasing international isolation over its devastating war in Gaza and could open the door for other major nations to perhaps follow suit. PALESTINIAN LEADER WELCOMES FRENCH MOVE Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in a statement welcoming the French move, credited the leadership of Saudi Arabia with playing \"a key role in encouraging France's decision to recognise the State of Palestine\", the Palestinian official news agency WAFA reported. \"President Abbas urged all countries, especially European nations that have not yet recognised the State of Palestine, to do so based on the internationally endorsed two-state solution,\" it cited Abbas as saying. Saudi Arabia has been pushing France to recognise Palestine over the past year with efforts led by Saudi foreign minister Faisal bin Farhan, said a source close to the royal court. Palestinians have long sought to create an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem - lands Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war - through a mediated peace process. Many accuse Israel of having destroyed Palestinian statehood prospects through increased settlement building in the West Bank and by levelling much of Gaza during the current war. Israel rejects this. The Palestine Liberation Organization recognised Israel's right to exist in peace in 1993 at the start of the U.S.-backed peace process which set up the Palestinian Authority, which Abbas heads, in what Palestinians hoped would be a stepping stone towards statehood. But Hamas and other Palestinian Islamist militants who dominate Gaza and frequently clash with Israeli forces in the West Bank refuse to recognise Israel. Hamas' 1988 founding charter called for the destruction of Israel, although Hamas leaders have at times offered a long-term truce with Israel in return for a viable Palestinian state on all Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. Israel regards this as a ruse.

REUTERS/Heiko Becker Summary Yemeni plaintiffs criticise decision as 'dangerous' Berlin not required to intervene in US drone activities BERLIN, July 15 (Reuters) - Berlin is not required to intervene in U.S. drone activities at the Ramstein air base in southwestern Germany, the country's top court ruled on Tuesday in dismissing a complaint brought by Yemeni nationals whose family members were killed in a strike. The constitutional court's ruling rejected the complaints of two men living in Yemen who lost two relatives - one an imam who had preached against al Qaeda and the other a police officer - in a 2012 U.S. drone strike. Sign up here. The men say they have since been living in fear for their lives and that Germany bears joint responsibility for the deaths because the drone missions were supported from Ramstein. At issue was the question of whether Germany had a responsibility to ensure a relay station at Ramstein that sends satellite data to drones did not violate international law. The court ruled that, while Germany did have a general duty to protect fundamental human rights including those of foreigners abroad, the conditions triggering that duty were not met. Berlin was acting within its purview on foreign and security policy when it accepted the United States' interpretation of what was allowable under international law, the court said. \"It could not be established that the U.S. is applying unacceptable criteria for distinguishing between legitimate military targets and protected civilians in the conflict in Yemen,\" wrote one of the judges in the ruling. In a statement, the two Yemeni plaintiffs, Ahmed and Khaled bin Ali Jaber, criticized the ruling as \"dangerous and shocking\", saying it sent a message that states supporting the U.S. drone programme were not held responsible when civilians were killed. Germany's foreign and defence ministries welcomed the ruling as confirmation of the government's legal opinion. The judges confirmed that \"the federal government has broad discretion in assessing the conformity of third countries' actions with international law\". The Ramstein public affairs office was not able to comment on the court case. The German government had argued that Germany's ability to take part in military alliances would be jeopardised if it had to ensure operations conducted by foreign militaries abroad adhered to Germany's understanding of international law simply because they had a base on German soil. The United States and Germany are allies in NATO and Washington has had a military base at Ramstein since 1948.

While Wall Street was in sideways mode seemingly fatigued by tariff headlines, the beaten down dollar posted the second of back-to-back gains and Treasury yields ticked higher for the fifth day running.

In the meantime the market will stay ready for surprising turns from the White House and otherwise be waiting for economic data, the Federal Reserve and other known unknowns to incentivize trade. No major indicators are on the calendar this week, and the only set pieces to look for Wednesday are the auction of $39 billion of 10-year notes, the Treasury's benchmark U.S. debt instrument, and the release of minutes from the Fed's last meeting when they held the policy rate at 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December.

REUTERS/Jeenah Moon/File photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab ORLANDO, Florida, July 15 (Reuters) - TRADING DAY Making sense of the forces driving global markets Sign up here. By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist The S&P 500 and Nasdaq leaped to new highs on Tuesday thanks to a surge in Nvidia shares, but closed mixed as investors digested a pick-up in U.S. inflation , a raft of major U.S. financial firms' earnings and spiking bond yields around the world, especially in Japan More on that below, but in my column today I ask whether there is a sense of tariff complacency creeping into markets , as investors increasingly bet on the 'TACO' trade. If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today. Today's Key Market Moves The Nasdaq gains 0.2% but other U.S. indices fall, with the Russell 2000 small cap index losing 1.7%. Tech is the only sector on the S&P 500 to rise. Nvidia shares rise 4% to a new high above $172, pushing its market cap further above the $4 trillion mark. Britain's FTSE 100 rises above 9000 points for the first time ever but ends down 0.6%, its biggest fall since post-Liberation Day turmoil in early April. Japanese Government Bond yields hit fresh highs. The 10-year yield is its highest since 2008 at 1.595%, and the 20- and 30-year yields at record peaks of 2.65% and 3.20%, respectively. The dollar index rises for a seventh session, its best run since last October. Bond blues mar stocks' joy It was a mixed bag on world markets on Tuesday. Two of Wall Street's three main indices, Britain's FTSE 100 and the MSCI World index hit fresh peaks, yet U.S. inflation rose, bond yields marched higher and investors gave a thumbs down to seemingly solid earnings from U.S. financial firms Equity market strength was mostly in tech, after AI darling and chipmaker Nvidia said overnight it plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China. Hong Kong's tech index got the ball rolling with a 2.8% rise, and tech was the only sector on the S&P 500 to close in the green. But if the market's glass was half full at the start of the day, it was half empty by the end of it. U.S. inflation was broadly in line with expectations, yet investors focused on the upside risks; U.S. bank earnings were solid, but financials were among the biggest decliners. The shadow of higher bond yields is beginning to lengthen as worries over governments' fiscal health, tariff-driven inflation and investor appetite for fixed income assets pick up again. The 30-year U.S. Treasury yield is back above 5.00%, but the eye of the bond market hurricane appears to be in Japan. Investor angst around an Upper House election on Sunday is bubbling up. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's sliding popularity suggests even his modest goal of retaining a majority is out of reach, and defeat could bring anything from a shift in the makeup of Ishiba's coalition to his resignation. Japanese government bond yields are surging, but that's proving to be a headwind for the yen rather than a tailwind as extra pressure on the country's already strained public finances, a straight-jacketed Bank of Japan and stagflation fears more than offset any potential carry for yen investors. The yen slumped to a three-month low on Tuesday, back within sight of the 150 per dollar mark. The raft of economic indicators from China overnight, meanwhile, generally showed activity in June held up better than economists expected, and second quarter GDP growth was slightly stronger than forecasts too. But Beijing is still under pressure to inject more stimulus into the economy. The property bubble continues to deflate, with new home prices falling at their fastest pace in eight months, and more broadly, China's economic surprises index is its lowest in three months. If incoming data is beating forecasts, it is because expectations have been lowered so much. Tariff 'doom loop' hangs over global equities The astonishing rebound in stocks since early April largely reflects investors' bet that U.S. President Donald Trump won't follow through on his tariff threats. But the market's very resilience may encourage the president to push forward, which could be bad news for equities in both the U.S. and Europe. Investors appear to believe that the April 2 \"reciprocal\" tariffs were mostly a tactic to bring countries to the negotiating table, and Washington's levies will end up being much lower than advertised. Tariffs may end up much higher than they were before Trump's second term began, but the situation will still be better than the worst-case scenarios initially priced in after Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\". Monday's equity moves were a case in point. Trump's threat on Saturday to impose 30% levies on imports from the European Union and Mexico - two of America's largest trading partners - was met with a collective market shrug. European and Mexican stocks dipped a bit, but Wall Street closed in the green and the Nasdaq hit a new high. This follows threats in recent days to place a 50% tariff rate on goods imported from Brazil and a 35% levy on goods from Canada not covered under the USMCA agreement. Brazilian stocks have slipped 5%, but Canadian stocks have hit new peaks. The question now is whether the line between complacency and the \"TACO\" trade - the bet that \"Trump always chickens out\" - is getting blurred. GETTING STRETCHED The scale of the recovery since April 7 is truly eye-popping. It took the S&P 500 less than three months to move from the April bear market lows to a new all-time high, as Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at Creative Planning, recently noted on X. This was the second-fastest recovery in the last 75 years, only bested by the bear market recovery in 1982 that took less than two months. On a 12-month forward earnings basis, the S&P 500 index is now near its highest level in years and well above its long-term average. The tech sector, which has propelled the rally, has rarely been more expensive in the last quarter century either. None of that means further gains cannot materialize, and one could argue that the valuations are justified if AI truly delivers the promised world-changing productivity gains. Regardless, it is hard to argue that the rally since April is not rooted in the belief that tariffs will be significantly lower than the levels announced on Liberation Day. If many countries' levies do end up around 10% like Britain's and the aggregate rate settles around 15%, then equity pricing might very well be reasonable. But if that's not the case, growth forecasts will likely have to be revised a lot lower. \"We stay overweight U.S. stocks, but don't rule out more sharp near-term market moves. Uncertainty on who will bear tariff costs means yet more dispersion in returns – and more opportunity to earn alpha, or above-benchmark returns,\" BlackRock Investment Institute analysts wrote on Monday. DOOM LOOP? One concern is that a loop is potentially being created, whereby Wall Street's resilience and strength in the face of heightened trade uncertainty actually emboldens Trump to double down on tariffs. Most analysts still believe cooler heads will prevail, however. Trump's tolerance for equity and bond market stress, and therefore U.S. economic pain, appears \"limited\", according to Barclays. But if markets have gotten too complacent and Trump does increase tariffs on EU goods to 30%, potential retaliation would risk a repeat of something similar to the post-Liberation Day selloff, sending European equities down by double digits, Barclays warns. It may also be that when it comes to tariffs, investors are focusing so intently on China that not much else moves the dial. This may be short-sighted though. China accounted for 13.4% of U.S. goods imports last year, the lowest in 20 years. In contrast, the U.S. imported $605.7 billion of goods from the European Union, or 18.6% of all imports and the most from any single jurisdiction. As Trump sees it, Europe is \"ripping off\" America almost as much as China. Bilateral U.S.-China trade last year totaled $582 billion, compared with bilateral U.S.-EU trade flows of $975 billion, U.S. Census data shows. America's $235.9 billion goods deficit with the EU was smaller than its $295.5 billion gaps with China, but that's still comfortably America's second-biggest trade deficit.

REUTERS/Nathan Howard/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab July 7 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole. Well, that's as clear as mud. Apparently August 1 is now the U.S. deadline for when higher tariffs will be imposed on some countries if no trade deals are done, or under way. It's not really certain which countries that covers, or which deals. Sign up here. President Trump 's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that, if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level,\" Treasury Secretary Bessent told CNN. The \" letters \" are going out to 10 or 12 countries today, presumably the same letters that were supposed to go last Friday. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters that the higher tariffs would take effect on August 1, but Trump was \"setting the rates and the deals right now\". Announcing trade policy changes in TV interviews does not make for clarity, and now it's uncertain if the original July 9 deadline matters, and for whom. India and the U.S., for instance, reportedly could make a mini-deal today or tomorrow, but then continue talks after July 9. According to Bessent, it also seems many countries didn't bother to contact the U.S. for talks - and will likely be getting stiff letters in return. Trump added to the confusion by mentioning that some tariffs could reach 60% or 70%, higher even than the 50% set on China. He also threatened an extra 10% tariff on countries aligning themselves with the \"anti-American policies\" of the BRICS, a group the U.S. itself is in tariff talks with. Investors have reacted with bemusement and nudged Wall St futures down 0.4% or so. Asian share indices are mostly lower on Monday, though not by much, while Treasury yields are down a basis point and the dollar stuck near four-year lows. Oil has been the big mover, losing around 1% after OPEC+ surprised by increasing production by much more than first expected, and flagging a similar increase for September. Analysts largely see this as Saudi Arabia putting the squeeze on higher-cost producers to capture market share, with low-margin U.S. shale output under particular pressure.

A July 9 date to secure trade deals with the United States was reset to August 1, and even as 14 nations received letters about tariff hikes on their goods, Trump's words left plenty of time and wiggle room for negotiation. Since Trump's unveiling of his sweeping \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2, each additional policy change has obeyed the economic maxim of \"diminishing marginal returns\" in terms of market reaction. Still, 25% duties on goods from Japan and South Korea, America's second- and third-largest trade partners in Asia, are still a hefty burden. More letters are expected to be doled out to other countries this week, keeping tariffs on the front pages. For the time being, a sense of deja vu is keeping market moves muted. This range plot displays the U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff rates on July 7, 2025, compared to the previously announced rates on April 2, 2025. The European Union is not among those expected to get a letter , EU sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. The EU still aims to reach a trade deal by Wednesday after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Trump had a \"good exchange,\" a commission spokesperson said. Since April, the Trump administration has put together just two, thinly sketched out trade agreements, with Britain and Vietnam, and a fragile trade truce with China. The U.S. dollar has been one of the biggest casualties from the tariff turmoil, but it bounced back strongly on Monday and held gains in Asia. Strength in the greenback against Japan's yen and the South Korean won added a tailwind to their major share indexes on Tuesday. Equity futures are indicating a down day broadly for Europe , whereas the U.S. market is poised for a flat open.

I remain bullish on gold, even though we're well within the range that has been in place since the middle of May,\" said Peter Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals. Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened higher tariffs, including 30% on imports from the European Union and Mexico. Data out Tuesday showed the U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 0.3% last month, in line with expectations, after edging up 0.1% in May. That was the largest gain since January. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that since consumer prices were low, the Federal Reserve should bring down interest rates. He has insisted on cutting rates for some time now. The Fed will likely be able to start cutting short-term borrowing costs by September, traders continued to bet after the data. \"Honestly, gold should be perkier. This seems to reinforce the view that we need a new driver to push gold back up past $3,400,\" said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader. Investors await U.S. Producer Price Index data on Wednesday for guidance. Gold, a safe-haven asset during times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, tends to thrive in low-interest-rate environments, as it offers no yield.

The results marked the first time that AI systems crossed the gold-medal scoring threshold at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) for high-school students. Sign up here. Both companies' models solved five out of six problems, achieving the result using general-purpose \" reasoning \" models that processed mathematical concepts using natural language, in contrast to the previous approaches used by AI firms. While Google DeepMind worked with the IMO to have their models graded and certified by the committee, OpenAI did not officially enter the competition. The startup revealed their models have achieved a gold medal-worthy score on this year's questions on Saturday, citing grades by three external IMO medalists. The achievement suggests AI is less than a year away from being used by mathematicians to crack unsolved research problems at the frontier of the field, according to Junehyuk Jung, a math professor at Brown University and visiting researcher in Google's DeepMind AI unit. \"I think the moment we can solve hard reasoning problems in natural language will enable the potential for collaboration between AI and mathematicians,\" Jung told Reuters. OpenAI's breakthrough was achieved with a new experimental model centered on massively scaling up \"test-time compute.\" This was done by both allowing the model to \"think\" for longer periods and deploying parallel computing power to run numerous lines of reasoning simultaneously, according to Noam Brown, researcher at OpenAI. Brown declined to say how much in computing power it cost OpenAI, but called it \"very expensive.\" To OpenAI researchers, it is another clear sign that AI models can command extensive reasoning capabilities that could expand into other areas beyond math. The optimism is shared by Google researchers, who believe AI models' capabilities can apply to research quandaries in other fields such as physics, said Jung, who won an IMO gold medal as a student in 2003. Of the 630 students participating in the 66th IMO on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia, 67 contestants, or about 11%, achieved gold-medal scores. Google's DeepMind AI unit last year achieved a silver medal score using AI systems specialized for math. This year, Google used a general-purpose model called Gemini Deep Think, a version of which was previously unveiled at its annual developer conference in May. Unlike previous AI attempts that relied on formal languages and lengthy computation, Google's approach this year operated entirely in natural language and solved the problems within the official 4.5-hour time limit, the company said in a blog post. OpenAI, which has its own set of reasoning models , similarly built an experimental version for the competition, according to a post by researcher Alexander Wei on social media platform X. He noted that the company does not plan to release anything with this level of math capability for several months. This year marked the first time the competition coordinated officially with some AI developers, who have for years used prominent math competitions like IMO to test model capabilities. IMO judges certified the results of those companies, including Google, and asked them to publish results on July 28. \"We respected the IMO Board's original request that all AI labs share their results only after the official results had been verified by independent experts and the students had rightly received the acclamation they deserved,\" Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said on X on Monday. OpenAI, which published its results on Saturday and first claimed gold-medal status, said in an interview that it had permission from an IMO board member to do so after the closing ceremony on Saturday. The competition on Monday allowed cooperating companies to publish results, Gregor Dolinar, president of IMO's board, told Reuters.

Thai and Cambodian leaders met in Malaysia on Monday and agreed to a ceasefire to halt their deadliest conflict in more than a decade, which has killed at least 43 people, many of them civilians, and displaced over 300,000 in both countries.

Border areas remained calm, Thailand's acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters in Bangkok, although he accused Cambodian troops of violating the ceasefire early on Tuesday. Cambodia denied this, insisting its troops had strictly abided by the ceasefire since midnight, according to a statement by Defence Minister Tea Seiha. Despite the initial jitters, military commanders from both sides held talks and agreed to maintain the ceasefire, stop any troop movement, and facilitate the return of the wounded and dead, Thai army spokesman Major-General Winthai Suvaree said. Each side will establish a coordinating team of four to resolve any problems, Winthai told reporters. Cambodia's influential former premier Hun Sen, in a Facebook post, thanked \"the armies of both Cambodia and Thailand for respecting and implementing this agreement\". Further negotiations will continue at a meeting of the General Border Committee, which coordinates on border security, ceasefires, and troop deployments, scheduled for August 4 in Cambodia, the Thai army said. The committee includes the defence ministers and senior military commanders from both countries. In a statement, the Thai army said it had detained 18 Cambodian soldiers who surrendered. A Cambodian defence ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions on the detentions.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more TALKS AND TRADE Thailand and Cambodia have wrangled for decades over their disputed frontier and have been on a conflict footing since the killing of a Cambodian soldier in a skirmish late in May, which led to a troop buildup on both sides and a full-blown diplomatic crisis. Monday's peace talks came after a sustained push by Malaysian Premier Anwar Ibrahim and U.S. President Donald Trump, with the latter warning Thai and Cambodian leaders that trade negotiations would not progress if fighting continued. Thailand and Cambodia face a tariff of 36% on their goods in the U.S., their biggest export market, unless a reduction can be negotiated. After the ceasefire deal was reached, Trump said he had spoken to both leaders and instructed his trade team to restart tariff talks. Pichai Chunhavajira, Thailand's finance minister, said on Tuesday that trade talks with Washington were expected to be concluded before August 1. Thailand has estimated initial damage from the border conflict at more than 10 billion baht ($300 million), Pichai said. The government is preparing a budget of at least 25 billion baht to mitigate the economic impact, and has rolled out relief measures including soft loans, loan repayment deferrals and tax breaks, he said. Daily activity resumed some parts of Thailand's border areas, including the Kantharalak district, about 30 km (20 miles) from the frontline, where Chaiya Phumjaroen, 51, returned to town to reopen his shop. \"I am very happy that a ceasefire happened,\" he said. \"If they continue to fight, we have no opportunity to make money.\" The ceasefire deal reflected a rare convergence of interest between the U.S. and China, which also pushed for the talks, but the agreement remains fragile, and third-party monitoring is essential to keep it in place, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. \"It cannot be left to Thailand and Cambodia to implement because the hostilities are running so deep now.\" Reporting by Panu Wongcha-um, Panarat Thepgumpanat and Chayut Setboonsarng in BANGKOK, Shoon Naing in KANTHARALAK and Zaw Naing Oo and Chantha Lach in ODDAR MEANCHEY; Additional reporting by Orathai Sriring, Poppy McPherson and Juarawee Kittisilpa in BANGKOK, and Danial Azhar in KUALA LUMPUR; Writing by Devjyot Ghoshal; Editing by John Mair and Raju Gopalakrishnan Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab"

Cement prices rose about 2% on-year on average in the quarter, according to brokerage Ambit Capital, extending the steady recovery so far this year after last year's slump. Finance chief Atul Daga said in a post-earnings call that cement prices have continued to improve in July, especially in the South Indian markets, which emerged out of a long pricing lull in April. \"Prices have (been) favorably poised in spite of heavy monsoons ,\" Daga said. The company reported a revenue of 212.75 billion rupees, surpassing analysts' estimates of 200.12 billion rupees. However, its consolidated sales volume growth of 9.7% was near the lower side of the 9.6%-17.5% growth range projected by four brokerages. Heavy rains dampened demand in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Odisha, while geopolitical tensions stalled construction activity in India's northern border states, the company said. India and Pakistan saw their worst clashes in decades in the quarter, following a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir in April. The April-June period is also a seasonally soft quarter for cement companies, as monsoon showers slow construction.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/ File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab HONG KONG, July 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's home prices were largely unchanged for a second consecutive month in June on lower mortgage rates, government data showed on Tuesday, signalling stabilization after recent steep declines. BY THE NUMBERS Private home prices edged up 0.03% in June from the month before, following a revised 0.03% rise in May, data from the Rating and Valuation Department showed. In April, home prices climbed a revised 0.5%, ending four months of decline. Sign up here. Prices have dropped 0.9% this year to their lowest since 2016. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Home prices in Hong Kong, one of the world's most unaffordable cities, have tumbled nearly 30% from a 2021 peak, hurt by higher mortgage rates, a weak economic outlook, and poor demand as many professionals have left the territory. Authorities tried to prop up the sector last year, lifting all curbs on property purchases and relaxing down payment ratios, but housing demand has remained soft. CONTEXT The one-month Hong Kong dollar interbank rate HIBOR , which many mortgage plans are linked to, dropped below 1.2% since May from more than 3.5% in the past two years, making mortgage rates more affordable for home buyers. WHAT'S NEXT Realtors forecast home prices in 2025 could rise or fall by 5%, depending on the pace of official rate cuts and the severity of trade tensions between China and the United States. Brokerages including Morgan Stanley and HSBC recently said they expected the Hong Kong residential market to bottom out. But realtor JLL, which sees a 5% drop in mass residential prices this year, said it does not expect a sustainable recovery until 2026, when inventory could drop to a healthy level.

They are accused of organising or participating in the \"Hong Kong Parliament\", a group that authorities in the Asian financial hub say aimed to subvert state power, under the law Beijing imposed in 2020 following months of pro-democracy protests in 2019. Sign up here. The activists are accused of having launched a referendum or run as candidates in the unofficial \"Hong Kong Parliament\" group, which authorities say aims at achieving self-determination and drafting a \"Hong Kong constitution\". Police, who said the organisation sought to overthrow the governments of China and Hong Kong by unlawful means, said they are still investigating and further arrests may follow. Among those named are businessman Elmer Yuen, commentator Victor Ho, and activists Johnny Fok and Tony Choi. Four of them are subject to previous arrest warrants, each carrying a bounty of HK$1 million ($127,000). Among the remaining 15, for each of whom police are offering a bounty of HK$200,000 ($25,480), are those said to have organised or run in the election and sworn in as its councillors. None of the accused could be reached for comment. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday condemned the move , which he said targeted some U.S.-based individuals. \"We will not tolerate the Hong Kong government’s attempts to apply its national security laws to silence or intimidate Americans or anyone on U.S. soil,\" he wrote in a statement, calling it \"a form of transnational repression.\" The UK's Foreign and Home Secretaries also condemned the move in a joint statement, calling the arrests \"another example of transnational repression\" and saying it damages Hong Kong's international reputation. \"(The UK) will not tolerate attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas,\" it said in a statement on Friday. In response, the Chinese embassy in the UK said the British government's remarks \"constitute a gross interference\" in China's internal affairs and the rule of law in Hong Kong. \"China urges the UK to abandon its colonial mentality, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs...stop shielding criminals,\" it said. The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy, including freedom of speech, under a \"one country, two systems\" formula. Critics of the national security law say authorities are using it to stifle dissent. Chinese and Hong Kong officials have repeatedly said the law was vital to restore stability after the city was rocked for months by sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019. Police reiterated that national security offenses were serious crimes with extraterritorial reach and urged the wanted individuals to return to Hong Kong and surrender. \"If offenders voluntarily give up continuing to violate the crime, turn themselves in, truthfully confess their crimes, or provide key information that helps solve other cases, they may be eligible for reduced punishment,\" they said in a statement. Police also warned that aiding, abetting, or funding others to participate in the \"Hong Kong Parliament\" could be a criminal offense.

REUTERS/Cindy Liu/File Photo BANGKOK, July 24 (Reuters) - Months of simmering tensions between Cambodia and Thailand exploded into armed conflict on Thursday, including the deployment of a Thai F-16 fighter jet, in the heaviest fighting between the Southeast Asian neighbours in over a decade. Here is a look at the defence forces and arsenals of two countries, according to data from the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies: Sign up here. BUDGETS AND GROUND PERSONNEL Cambodia had a defence budget of $1.3 billion in 2024 and 124,300 active military personnel. The armed forces were established in 1993 from the merger of the country's former Communist military and two other resistance armies. Of this, the Cambodian army is the largest force, with some 75,000 soldiers, backed by more than 200 battle tanks and around 480 pieces of artillery. Thailand, which the U.S. classifies as a major non-NATO ally, has a large, well-funded military, with a defence budget of $5.73 billion in 2024 and over 360,000 active armed forces personnel. The Thai army has a total of 245,000 personnel, including an estimated 115,000 conscripts, around 400 battle tanks, over 1,200 armoured personnel carriers and some 2,600 artillery weapons. The army has its own fleet of aircraft, comprising passenger planes, helicopters such as dozens of U.S.-made Black Hawks, and unmanned aerial vehicles. AIR FORCES Cambodia's air force has 1,500 personnel, with a relatively small fleet of aircraft, including 10 transport planes and 10 transport helicopters. It doesn't possess any fighter aircraft but has 16 multi- role helicopters, including six Soviet-era Mi-17s and 10 Chinese Z-9s. Thailand has one of the best equipped and trained air forces in Southeast Asia, with an estimated 46,000 personnel, 112 combat capable aircraft, including 28 F-16s and 11 Swedish Gripen fighter jets, and dozens of helicopters. NAVIES The Cambodian navy has an estimated 2,800 personnel, including 1,500 naval infantry, with 13 patrol and coastal combat vessels and one amphibious landing craft. Thailand's navy is much larger, with nearly 70,000 personnel, comprising naval aviation, marines, coastal defence and conscripts. It has one aircraft carrier, seven frigates, and 68 patrol and coastal combat vessels. The Thai fleet also contains a handful of amphibious and landing ships capable of holding hundreds of troops each and 14 smaller landing craft. Thailand's naval aviation division has its own fleet of aircraft, including helicopters and UAVs, besides a marine corps that has 23,000 personnel, backed by dozens of armed fighting vehicles.

    "full_text": "In three videos verified by Reuters, attackers in military garb carried out execution-style killings of unarmed Druze civilians in southern Syria. The killings came after Syrian government forces deployed in response to unrest between Druze militias and Bedouin fighters. Screenshots via social media. The fighters in military-style uniforms pointed their rifles at the three unarmed men and ordered them out onto a sunny balcony, before barking at them to pause. “One minute. You want to film them?” one of the attackers asked his comrade. The unfolding horror, which was already being filmed by one gunman on his cellphone, was delayed for a few moments to allow a second fighter to start capturing the events. “Let’s go! Throw yourself over,” the gunmen yelled at their victims, members of Syria’s minority Druze faith. Two of the attackers shot the men one by one as they clambered over the black railing before their bodies tumbled to the street below, according to the footage circulating on social media which was reviewed by Reuters. The victims were Moaz Arnous, his brother Baraa Arnous and their cousin, Osama Arnous, according to a family friend and another cousin who both told Reuters the video showed the three being killed at their home in the southern city of Sweida on July 16. The deaths were among 12 execution-style killings of unarmed Druze civilians carried out at three sites in and around Sweida this month by gunmen wearing military fatigues, according to the footage of the attacks, which was filmed by the killers themselves or people accompanying them and verified by Reuters. Another video shows Mounir al-Rajma, a 60-year-old guard at a communal water well, being gunned down by two young fighters after telling them he is Druze, his son Wiam told Reuters. Other footage shows a group of fighters forcing eight civilians to kneel in the dust of a roundabout before shooting them dead, according to a friend and a relative of some of those victims. Reuters used landmarks in each video as well as interviews with family and friends to verify the footage and confirm how the killings unfolded. Videos via social media The videos provide some of the most detailed depictions yet of the bloodshed that erupted in Sweida province in mid-July, initially between local Druze militia and Bedouin tribal fighters and subsequently government forces sent to restore order. The violence killed hundreds of mostly Druze people, according to Reuters reporting and two monitoring groups. Reuters was able to use visible landmarks in each video to geo-locate the incidents. The events depicted and their dates were verified through interviews with seven relatives and friends of the victims. All said they believed Syrian government forces killed their loved ones. The news agency could not identify the attackers in the videos, which were not time-stamped, or determine who first posted them online. The pieces of footage began appearing online after July 18, a review of social media posts found. The media offices of the Syrian defence and interior ministries didn’t respond to questions from Reuters on the filmed attacks. Syria’s defense ministry said on July 22 that it was aware of reports that an “unknown group” wearing military fatigues committed “shocking and gross violations” in Sweida. It didn’t mention execution-style killings targeting Druze people. The ministry vowed to investigate the abuses, identify those responsible and impose “maximum penalties” on perpetrators, “even if they are affiliated with the ministry of defense.” On the same day, the interior ministry condemned “in the strongest terms the circulating videos showing field executions carried out by unidentified individuals in the city of Sweida”. RIGHTS GROUP: AT LEAST 1,000 DEAD Syria has been plagued by bouts of sectarian strife since the sudden fall of President Bashar al-Assad and his police state in December last year after 14 years of war. The new government, led by a former Sunni Islamist group that has its roots in global jihad, dissolved Assad’s army and sought to integrate dozens of former rebel factions into a national army, but those forces have struggled to fill the security vacuum.

REUTERS/Stringer A Bedouin fighter passes a burnt building in the predominantly Druze region of Sweida. Hundreds of people died during sectarian violence, most of them Druze, according to Reuters reporting and two monitoring groups. REUTERS/Stringer Charred vehicles littered Sweida's roads and many homes were torched during days of violence in southern Syria. REUTERS/Stringer Sweida province is predominantly populated by the Druze community , a distant offshoot of Islam that comprises about 3% of Syria’s pre-war population of 24 million. The atrocities there came four months after a spree of killings against the Alawite minority, with armed factions affiliated to the new government killing hundreds of people in coastal settlements. The Sweida unrest began on July 13 when longstanding local tensions over land and resources in the province escalated into clashes between local Druze militia and Bedouin tribal fighters, who like government forces largely adhere to the country’s majority Sunni faith. The violence worsened significantly after the Syrian military was deployed to the province on July 14 to quell the clashes and entered Sweida city itself on July 15, according to residents, two war monitors and reporters on the ground. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said 1,013 people have been killed in the bloodshed since July 13, including 47 women, 26 children and six medical personnel. The group said victims were mainly Druze, adding that it wasn’t clear how many were fighters or civilians. The network said the vast majority died after the army’s arrival led to a sharp increase in fighting. The organization’s head, Fadel Abdulghany, told Reuters it had documented execution-style killings by Syrian troops, Bedouin fighters and Druze groups. A forensic pathologist in the city of Sweida, who requested anonymity to speak about sensitive matters, told Reuters he had examined 502 bodies that had been brought to the Sweida National Hospital during this month’s violence. Many of the dead were taken to Sweida National Hospital. A forensic pathologist told Reuters he had examined 502 bodies that arrived after the sectarian violence. REUTERS/Stringer One was decapitated and two, including a teenage girl, had their throats slit. Most of the others suffered from gunshot wounds inflicted at close range, he said. Reuters could not independently verify the numbers or specific atrocities recounted by the Syrian network and the pathologist. ‘ARE YOU MUSLIM OR DRUZE?’ The son of Rajma, the 60-year-old water well guard, identified his father in a video verified by Reuters as having been filmed on July 15 outside the Muhammad Salih Nasr School in the town of Thaalah, less than a mile from their home. Rajma is seen sitting on the steps of the school’s entrance as at least three young rifle-toting men in military fatigues are heard repeatedly screaming at him, “Are you Muslim or Druze?” The exchange is filmed by someone standing directly next to the fighters and it is unclear if the person is also armed. When the older man answers, “I’m Syrian”, one fighter responds: “What does Syrian mean? Muslim or Druze?” Rajma says: “My brother, I’m Druze.” Three of the fighters immediately open fire. “This is the fate of every dog among you, you pigs,” one of them says. In another video verified by Reuters, a group of seven fighters in military fatigues carrying rifles are seen guiding eight men in civilian clothes down a sidewalk. Based on the shop signs and road layout, Reuters identified the street as lying just west of Tishreen Square in the heart of Sweida city. The only visible insignia on the fatigues is a small black patch on the right arm of one of the fighters bearing the Islamic declaration of faith in a design popularized by the Islamic State group. Reuters reporters have also seen some soldiers at checkpoints in government areas wearing them. This is the fate of every dog among you, you pigs. Syrian attacker Syria’s defense and interior ministries didn’t respond to questions on whether their forces wear the patches. The Islamic State did not mention Sweida in any of their posts on their social media propaganda channels, including in the period after July 13. Reuters couldn’t reach a representative for the group. A few seconds into the video, the fighter filming turns his phone camera around to his own face: He’s a bearded man dressed in military fatigues, with a red bandana wrapped around his head and the butt of a rifle visible across his chest. The eight victims walk in single file, each resting his hands on the shoulders of the man in front. The last man in line, wearing a tan shirt and sandals, was identified by a friend who watched the video as Hosam Saraya , a 35-year-old Syrian-American citizen. The friend said the older man directly in front of him in line was Hosam’s father, and the next man was Hosam’s brother Kareem. Most of the others were from the same extended family, the friend added. Members of the Saraya family were taken from their apartment building and marched to Sweida's central Tishreen Square, where they and a friend died in an execution-style killing that was filmed by the attackers themselves. REUTERS/Stringer Bullet holes pockmarked the inside of the Saraya home. The wife of Ali Saraya, who was among the dead, said men in military fatigues surrounded the building and demanded the men inside surrender themselves. REUTERS/Stringer Dima Saraya, the wife of Ali Saraya – another of the men in line – told Reuters that armed men in military fatigues had surrounded the apartment building where the extended Saraya family lived west of Tishreen Square on July 16 and demanded that the men inside surrender themselves, promising to question them for a few hours and return them home safely. Related Content U.S. Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma confirmed that Hosam, who had lived in Oklahoma, “was tragically executed alongside other members of his family in Syria.” He didn’t give further details. A separate video shows the same eight unarmed men kneeling in the dirt of a roundabout in Tishreen Square. Reuters was able to verify the video’s location from the statue in the roundabout and a tower block visible directly behind it. The same friend identified Hosam, his brother and his father among the kneeling men in the second video. At least two fighters fire their rifles directly at the kneeling group, from close proximity and for at least seven seconds.

REUTERS/Nathan Howard/File Photo July 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump 's new tax and spending measures, which he signed into law on Friday , will hit some students in their pocketbooks when it comes to federal financial aid. The law will affect the amount that students and their families can borrow, as well as eligibility for Pell Grants, designed to help low-income undergraduate students. It will also put colleges and universities on the hook if their students fail to earn more than they would without a degree. Most changes take effect on July 1, 2026. Sign up here. GRADUATE LENDING AND LOAN CAPS Grad PLUS loans will be eliminated. They were created in 2006 to help graduate students cover the cost of attendance that exceeded the maximum $20,500 a year that graduate students received through unsubsidized Stafford loans. As of this year's second quarter, there were 1.8 million Grad PLUS borrowers, who had borrowed a total of $117.2 billion to pay for graduate school attendance, according to Federal Student Loan Portfolio data. Unsubsidized graduate borrowing for master's programs will be capped at $20,500 per year ($100,000 lifetime); $50,000/year for professional programs such as law and medicine ($200,000 lifetime). Right now, borrowers can apply for a Grad PLUS loan up to the cost of program attendance if they need more to cover tuition or living expenses. Parent PLUS loans will be subject to some changes. Parents can borrow if their student borrows the maximum limit of an unsubsidized Stafford loan and still has a remaining unmet need based on cost of attendance. Today, there is $114.3 billion owed across 3.6 million borrowers, according to Federal Student Loan Portfolio data. LOAN REPAYMENT Borrowers taking out loans after July 1, 2026, will have access to only two repayment plans: a standard repayment plan to be paid over 10-25 years, and a repayment assistance program where payments will be based on 1-10% of a borrower’s income, with a minimum monthly payment of $10. The remaining balance will be forgiven after 30 years. DEFERMENT AND FORBEARANCE The law has eliminated both Economic Hardship and Unemployment Deferment programs, which are tools for borrowers with financial challenges. Economic Hardship Deferment pauses payments, but interest still accrues. Once payment continues, accrued interest is added to the principal. As of this year, 70,000 borrowers under economic hardship deferment had $2.7 billion of outstanding debt, according to federal loan data. Under unemployment forbearance, borrowers can request to pause their payments, and interest accrues during the pause. Once payments restart, the accrued interest is added to existing interest, instead of the principal. Under the new law, borrowers can claim forbearance for only nine months within a 24-month period. In the current system, they can request it for 12 months at a time, for a total of three years or 36 months. PELL GRANTS Pell Grants are the first dollars awarded to low-income students who have yet to earn a post-secondary degree. Eligibility is based on household income, and 31.6% of undergraduate students received a Pell Grant in 2022, with an average award amount of $4,875. For the 2024-2025 school year, 2 million recipients received a total of $10 billion in Pell Grant aid, according to the federal student aid website. With the changes, Pell Grants will be the last aid provided. If students are offered full or partial scholarships from their schools or receive any outside scholarships, their eligibility for Pell will be limited. SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY The new law has created an accountability system that requires colleges to maintain positive outcomes for students in order for their programs to be paid using federal student loans. So-called low-earning outcome programs, or programs where the median earnings of graduates are less than a comparable working adult, are not eligible for federal funding. The law also makes changes to the gainful employment rule, an Obama-era regulation created to ensure that career training programs, mainly at for-profit institutions and non-degree programs at any institution, prepare students for jobs with adequate earnings to repay their student loans and to justify the investment in the program. It introduces a new standard based on graduate earnings that could have a similar effect on college program eligibility for federal funding.

GDC Inc./Handout via REUTERS Summary Businessman heads Congo trip to try to free U.S. prisoners Team of three runs foul of the authorities and has to flee Venture shows how Washington works with unofficial envoys DAKAR, July 11 (Reuters) - An Israeli-American businessman, a former State Department official and a decorated Green Beret pitched up in the Democratic Republic of Congo in March with a message for President Felix Tshisekedi from the Trump administration. Two days later, they fled the country in fear of arrest. Sign up here. The three envoys had come with an offer from Washington: release three American prisoners on death row and, in return, President Donald Trump will accept your minerals-for-security proposal. The trip started well with a police motorcycle escort from the airport, but a frosty first meeting with Tshisekedi's security adviser, some ill-advised late-night target practice by some of the envoys and a Congolese general with an axe to grind put paid to the mission. Reuters pieced together the course of events by speaking to the three Americans on the trip, a State Department official involved in the initiative, and two people the trio met during their brief stay in Congo's capital Kinshasa. The story of the ill-fated venture, which has not previously been reported, provides a glimpse of how the Trump administration is prepared to work through unconventional channels in pursuit of deals to bring Americans home, a top priority for the president. \"We want to work with folks who have the right connections, but more importantly, have the positive relationships that can help influence a decision-maker's thinking ... so it's not uncommon for us to do that,\" Dustin Stewart, Trump's deputy special envoy for hostage affairs, who was involved in discussions on the initiative, told Reuters. \"We thought they had enough sway to talk to the right people. Obviously, that proved incorrect,\" he said. President Tshisekedi's office did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Congo has become a focus of U.S. diplomatic efforts to end the decades-long conflict in the east and help American companies access critical minerals, making the country ripe territory for endeavours such as this mission. \"Trump gave every indication right from the beginning that he was going to be purely transactional,\" said Ebenezer Obadare, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"He's thrown out the old playbook. He's not going through normal diplomatic channels.\" AMERICANS ON DEATH ROW It all started in January this year when Israeli-American businessman Moti Kahana met the Congolese president on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos to warn him about a coup plot purportedly involving Israelis. Kahana handed over the names of the alleged plotters to Tshisekedi in an envelope, according to the businessman and two other people involved. Reuters could not determine whether the alleged plot was real. Kahana told Reuters he was aware that Washington had a number of live interests in Congo, and after returning from Davos he decided to try to arrange another meeting with Tshisekedi. Three Americans had been sentenced to death by a Congolese military court in September 2024 for participating in a separate, failed coup in May last year. Efforts to free them by the Biden government and the Trump administration had gained little traction. At the same time, negotiations were intensifying over a deal in which the United States would secure greater access to Congo's minerals in return for help defending the country from Rwanda-backed insurgents rampaging across its eastern provinces. To get the ball rolling, Kahana met with State Department officials in Washington in March. The officials thought it worth empowering a team led by Kahana to discuss U.S. diplomatic goals and the release of the three Americans with Tshisekedi, the businessman and the State Department's Stewart said. \"I don't think anybody had high hopes that they were going to be able to sort of go to Kinshasa and come back with those three,\" he said. \"But, again, I think reinforcing the message that it was important to find a positive resolution, it helped us.\" UNLIKELY CAST Kahana had a track record of extracting people from dangerous places. His exploits included rescuing about 200 Jewish orphans from Ukraine in 2022 and the last Jew from Afghanistan when the Taliban took control in 2021. For the Congo mission, he signed up two other Americans. One was former U.S. Green Beret Justin Sapp. He was among the first soldiers to infiltrate Afghanistan in 2001 and had explored a project with Kahana to deliver aid to Gaza the previous year. For Kahana, who said he does business alongside his philanthropic ventures, the motivation was to win praise for bringing home the Americans, while eyeing business opportunities in Congo. He brought in Sapp as an expert on security. \"He generally sees himself as the guy saving the day,\" said Sapp. \"Now, is he doing it for free? In the end, no.\" The other was Stuart Seldowitz, a business associate of Kahana's and former U.S. diplomat who was charged with a hate crime for verbally abusing a Halal hot dog vendor in New York in 2023. Seldowitz said the charges were dismissed after he completed a 26-week anti-bias course. Seldowitz was an old acquaintance of the U.S. ambassador to Congo, Lucy Tamlyn, which Kahana said could come in handy. On their first night in Kinshasa, the trio had expected a discussion over dinner with Tshisekedi's security adviser, Desire-Cashmir Kolongele Eberande. But they said he was not in a welcoming mood when he finally saw them at 1 a.m. \"We were supposed to have a meeting with the president the next day,\" Sapp said. \"In retrospect, I'm not sure we had a firm meeting with him. I think it was tentative, and they were going to sniff us out. And then we didn't pass the sniff test.\" Sapp said Eberande was suspicious about whether the trio were actually authorised to convey a message from Trump. Eberande did not respond to requests for comment about the American mission. Kahana reached out to Washington for help. The next day, Stewart sent an email to Eberande confirming the State Department knew of the visitors, and Eberande begrudgingly accepted their credentials, Kahana said. \"Per our previous exchange, this is to confirm that I am aware of the travel of Mr. Seldowitz and Mr. Kahana as it pertains to the status of the three Americans in custody,\" Stewart wrote in the email, seen by Reuters. That evening, while the trio waited to see if President Tshisekedi would meet them, they were invited for dinner by an Israeli security contractor on a compound within an army base in Kinshasa. Another guest was an Israeli-French arms dealer who had been doing business in Congo for decades and helped set up Kahana's first meeting with Tshisekedi in Davos, according to the arms dealer, Kahana and Kinuani Kamitatu Massamba, a Congolese politician close to Tshisekedi. After dinner, the host invited the guests for a shooting session at the compound's range. Kahana and Sapp agreed to take part. The next morning, Kahana received a call from Massamba, who said Congo's intelligence services were upset about the late-night gunfire. Massamba told Reuters the shooting had raised alarm about a possible attack on the presidential palace. It was at that point that things became alarming for the Americans. 'GOOD TO BE AMERICAN' General Franck Ntumba, head of the presidential guard, showed up at their hotel, demanding they surrender their passports and visit his headquarters. \"He didn't look like he wanted to be screwed around with,\" Seldowitz said. Ntumba did not respond to requests for comment. Ntumba had been one of the people Kahana named as an alleged coup plotter to President Tshisekedi in Davos. Kahana said that before the trip he was slightly concerned about Ntumba, but was hopeful the general didn't know he was behind the list. Seldowitz called his old acquaintance the U.S. ambassador. A large contingent of embassy staff soon showed up at the hotel to protect the Americans, the Israeli-French arms dealer said. \"I thought, wow, it's good to be American in this situation. It was like a movie, believe me,\" he said. Ntumba eventually left, but warned the trio that things would not end there. An American security officer at the embassy gave them three options: stay in their hotel rooms and hope no one kicks down the doors, move to another hotel, or leave Congo immediately. \"And I said, well, I like the third option the best,\" said Kahana. The embassy sent a car with diplomatic plates to take them to the airport. The trio arrived as an Air France flight for Paris was boarding. But at passport control, they were taken into a room and asked for their phones. Seldowitz called the embassy again. Air France staff came and the three Americans were released. The U.S. embassy referred Reuters questions about the trio's mission to the State Department. Hostage envoy Stewart confirmed its staff had stepped in to rescue the three men. While the men's mission did not go as planned, progress has since been made on their initial goals. Massamba, Stewart and Kahana all said it helped signal that Trump was serious about striking a deal involving the American prisoners. In April, Tshisekedi commuted the sentences of the three Americans convicted of coup-plotting to life in prison. Soon afterwards, Trump's senior Africa adviser, Massad Boulos, visited Congo and the three were transferred to the United States, where they were charged with conspiring to carry out a coup on Congo. The men - Marcel Malanga, Tyler Thompson and Benjamin Zalman-Polun - are currently in custody after pleading not guilty. Their lawyers did not respond to requests for comment about the mission to free them. \"As you've seen, the three were pardoned and released,\" the State Department's Stewart said. \"That was the outcome that we were looking for.\" And in June, Congo and Rwanda signed a U.S.-brokered peace deal in Washington to end fighting in the mineral-rich east. \"We're getting, for the United States, a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo as part of it,\" said Trump.

Senegal is grappling with billions in debts hidden by the previous administration , which have prompted the IMF to freeze its loan programme. Sign up here. \"The purpose of the mission is going to be to discuss the steps needed to bring the misreporting case to our executive board,\" IMF communications director Julie Kozack said in a media briefing in Washington. \"The team will also use the opportunity to initiate discussions on the contours of a new IMF-supported program for Senegal.\" Separately, another Fund spokesperson said via email that it needs more data before it can firm up its assessment on Senegal's debt situation and also needs an agreement on key remedial measures. The IMF's executive board must either approve a misreporting waiver - many investors' base case - or order Senegal to pay back previous programme disbursements. With a waiver, Senegal could negotiate a new programme. \"Once we have reached agreement on the key corrective measures, the IMF Board will be in a position to consider the Senegal misreporting case and take a decision,\" a spokesperson for the Fund said in response to emailed questions from Reuters. An agreement on these measures could be reached \"hopefully within the coming weeks,\" that spokesperson added. Bonds jumped on the news. The euro-denominated 2028 bond gained more than 3 cents to bid at 82.88 cents on the euro, and the 2033 dollar-denominated bond gained nearly 3 cents to bid at 70.64 cents on the dollar. DEBT ICEBERG The IMF estimates - based on latest data from Senegalese authorities - that hidden debt stood at $11.3 billion by end-2023, the spokesperson added. This included a portion for state-owned enterprises of about 7.4% of GDP. There have been a range of estimates. S&P pegged the total hidden debt discovered since October 2024 at roughly $13 billion. The size of the hidden debt has escalated since September 2024, when the then newly elected government said an audit of government finances first flagged the issue. The scale dwarfs Mozambique's infamous \"tuna bond\" scandal -the most recent hidden debt case, which involved roughly $3 billion. The spokesperson said that the IMF, which has come under fire for not catching the off-the-books lending, will present information to the board on how it went undetected. \"The IMF is conducting an internal assessment and diagnostic as part of the misreporting process,\" the spokesperson added.

REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab CAIRO, July 16 (Reuters) - Egypt's progress on structural reforms under an $8 billion International Monetary Fund loan agreement has been mixed, the fund said, citing the public sector's continued dominance of the economy as a problem. In its long-delayed staff report for the fourth review of Egypt's programme, the IMF said there had been limited headway in reducing the role of state- and military-owned firms which enjoy preferential treatment in the form of tax exemptions, access to prime land and cheap labour. Sign up here. These companies remain largely shielded from public scrutiny, with \"very limited transparency about their financial condition\", the fund said. Egypt's reliance on a state-led growth model, centred on mega-projects and public investment, was curbing job creation and stifling the private sector in an increasingly volatile global environment, it said. \"The resulting financial and resource distortions have left Egypt with a large informal economy and few buffers against growing global financial, geopolitical and climate shocks,\" the fund said. The report was published late Tuesday, four months after the board approved the review and unlocked a $1.2 billion disbursement . Total disbursements are around $3.5 billion. The 46-month facility was signed in March 2024 following more than a year of severe foreign currency shortages and inflation that peaked at 38% in September 2023. The Fund said last week it would merge the fifth and sixth programme reviews into one later this year to give Egypt more time to implement critical reforms. Finance Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. The fund forecast that Egypt's external debt would rise from $162.7 billion in 2024/25 to $202 billion by 2029/30. Public debt overall \"poses a high risk of sovereign stress\", it said, urging authorities to broaden the tax base, phase out untargeted subsidies and increase oversight of off-budget entities such as the state oil company EGPC and the urban development authority NUCA. The report also cited \"persistent and successive external shocks\" that it said had \"complicated policy execution\", including the war in Sudan which has pushed hundreds of thousands to flee to Egypt, as well as trade disruptions in the Red Sea which reduced foreign exchange inflows from the Suez Canal by $6 billion last year.

REUTERS/Almaas Masood/ File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab (This was originally published in the India File newsletter, which is issued every Tuesday. Sign up here to get the latest news from India and how it matters to the world.) India has joined the global rush for weight-loss drugs as Novo Nordisk launched its popular Wegovy last week in the world's most populous country, just months after the arrival of rival Eli Lilly's Mounjaro. Sign up here. India's pharmaceutical powerhouses are also gearing up to launch generic versions of these drugs, putting it squarely on the map of what could become a $150 billion global market within the next 10 years. That's our focus this week. And, after a bountiful monsoon brought a bumper rice harvest, India is diverting record volumes to ethanol production to rein in inventories. Scroll down for more on that. THIS WEEK IN ASIA A NEW MARKET FOR WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS India looks poised to become the next big battleground in the booming market for weight-loss drugs, its strong economic growth and rapidly rising rates of obesity drawing the attention of both global pharmaceutical giants and home-grown generics makers. Denmark's Novo Nordisk last week began selling its blockbuster drug Wegovy in India while competitor Eli Lilly introduced an easy-to-use version of its Mounjaro , in what Jefferies predicts could soon grow into a $1 billion market. That's still a small fraction of the worldwide market, worth $24 billion last year according to IQVIA, while various forecasts indicate it could reach $150 billion early in the next decade. Many forecasts, moreover, have been raised sharply over the past year, and both analysts and industry executives have marked India and other big emerging markets as an essential driver of that growth. India lags only China in the number of adults with diabetes and its obesity rates are on the rise. A government survey last year noted that rising incomes and urbanisation have boosted consumption of processed food and beverages. \"Driven by unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, and environmental factors, obesity is rising rapidly, impacting both urban and rural populations,\" Nadim Anwer, pharmaceuticals analyst at data and analytics firm GlobalData, wrote in a report last month. \"This trend is driving market growth,\" Anwer said. A government health survey conducted from 2019 to 2021 found nearly one in four Indian adults was overweight or obese. Just five years earlier that figure was one in five. Looking at obesity alone, the World Obesity Federation estimated the rate among Indian adults at 8% in 2023, well below 22% in the U.S. But India's population is four times larger, and its adult obesity rate is forecast to keep rising to 11% by 2035. Novo Nordisk's Wegovy is approved in more countries than Mounjaro INDIA'S GENERICS POWERHOUSES POISED FOR BATTLE This has drawn the attention not just of overseas majors like Novo and Lilly. Indian pharmaceutical heavyweights such as Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr. Reddy's, Lupin and Biocon are preparing to launch cheaper generic drugs once semaglutide, the active compound in Wegovy, goes off-patent in 2026. Analysts at Jefferies said these big drugmakers would be particularly well-placed to benefit, given the complexity of manufacturing the drugs. Read here for details on firms looking to enter this segment. But these weight-loss drugs aren't going cheap - at least for now. Wegovy and Mounjaro are priced between 17,000 rupees and 26,000 rupees a month, putting them out of reach for most Indians without insurance or deep pockets. That hasn't dimmed enthusiasm among India's burgeoning urban middle class. Doctors across the country reported a surge in patient enquiries, mirroring the global frenzy, and Lilly said the response has been positive in India. While the entry of generics is likely to drive costs down eventually, other question marks hang over these drugs. New research has shown that they have a smaller impact in real life than in trials, the Reuters Health Rounds newsletter noted in its June edition . You can sign up for that newsletter here. Moreover, the World Health Organization said late last year that, while the drugs carry \"the possibility of an end to the obesity pandemic\", they also risk leaving behind those without access to proper healthcare and could overshadow other efforts to improve health. The WHO is due to release a report soon that would nevertheless back the use of such drugs for adults globally. Read here for that exclusive report. What do you think about the future of weight-loss drugs in India? Could it become a top world market - and manufacturer - for the pharmaceutical industry's latest blockbuster? Write to me at nidhi.csai@thomsonreuters.com , opens new tab MARKET MATTERS India’s ethanol blending in gasoline gains momentum as production of biofuel jumps from rice India is diverting record volumes of rice to ethanol production as it struggles with unprecedented inventories of the grain, which are likely to swell further with the arrival of the new harvest. India in March lifted the last of its rice export restrictions, which were adopted two years ago in response to poor rains. Now, the world's No.3 oil importer and consumer of petroleum products wants to harness that bumper harvest to meet its growing energy needs. The government has set a target to increase the proportion of gasoline blended with ethanol to 20% by 2025-26. It nearly hit that target in May, reaching 19.8%, with help from surplus rice.

Morgan said in a report on Friday. While surplus liquidity influences overnight borrowing costs, a recent analysis by the firm showed it does not impact credit or deposit growth in the economy. Sign up here. The Indian central bank has cut rates steeply and flooded the banking system with liquidity since December as it sought to counter signs of a slowdown in the Indian economy amid modest inflation. The Reserve Bank of India has said it hopes the combination of rate cuts and easy liquidity would help transmit lower interest rates across the economy and prompt individuals and firms to borrow more. Bank credit growth slipped to below 10% in May. \"We find that the role of liquidity in boosting monetary policy transmission occurs primarily through influencing overnight market rates, within the policy corridor,\" J.P. Morgan economists Toshi Jain, Sajjid Z Chinoy and Divyanit Sood said in the study dated July 4. \"There is no evidence of a 'credit channel' on deposit and lending growth beyond this.\" The economists added that the findings suggest the central bank should inject or withdraw only as much liquidity as needed to keep overnight rates aligned with the policy repo rate, adding that excess liquidity operations have no independent effect on credit growth. A large surplus of liquidity in the Indian market pushed overnight rates down to below the policy repo rate in recent months and, in some cases, even below the floor of the interest rate corridor. The RBI withdrew 1 trillion rupees ($11.7 billion) from the banking system on Friday through a seven-day variable rate reverse repo, rolling over an operation from last week, to ensure rates don't fall too low. India's policy repo rate, the mid-point of the corridor, stands at 5.50%, while the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate, the floor of the corridor, is at 5.25%. \"Pushing up the overnight rate will constitute a tightening of monetary policy at a delicate time. Yet, eventually, the sanctity of the operating target will need to be adhered to,\" J.P. Morgan economists said.

The Zambian government this year agreed to allocate 9,000 square km (3,475 square miles) to India for the exploration of cobalt - a key component in batteries for electric vehicles and mobile phones - as well as for scouting copper, which is widely used in power generation, electronics, and construction.

The team is expected to make multiple visits over the course of the entire project, said the sources, who declined to be identified because the information is not public. After assessing the mining potential, the Indian government will seek a mining lease from the Zambian government and may also invite private-sector companies to participate in the project, the sources said. India's Ministry of Mines did not respond to a request for comment. New Delhi has been in talks with several African countries to acquire critical mineral blocks on a government-to-government basis, while also exploring opportunities in Australia and Latin America. India is also in discussions with the Democratic Republic of Congo to sign an initial agreement to secure supplies of cobalt and copper, Reuters reported in March. An Indian delegation attended a mining conference in Congo last month and toured local mines, the ministry said in a post on X. India has held internal discussions over its growing vulnerability to a tightening global copper market and plans to explore ways to secure supply from resource-rich countries during ongoing trade negotiations, Reuters reported last week.

Unless new market-makers step in or volatility rises materially, turnover is unlikely to bounce back soon, Krishan said.

REUTERS/Priyanshu Singh/File photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab MUMBAI, July 16 (Reuters) - Cooling inflation in India and tariff-induced price pressures in the U.S. are cementing a downward bias on dollar-rupee forward premiums, according to analysts. India's retail inflation hit a six-year low in June, while U.S. consumer prices rose at their fastest pace since February, with higher goods costs hinting at tariff effects. Sign up here. This divergence is likely to persist. Economists project India's consumer price index inflation to touch a record low in July, while the tariff impact is seen becoming more pronounced in the U.S. inflation prints for July and August. Cooling domestic inflation is prompting calls for at least one more interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India, while analysts believe the rising U.S. price pressures due to tariffs may keep the Federal Reserve from cutting rates. BofA Global Research sees no Fed rate cuts in 2025 and urges investors to \"fade\" the 2025 easing priced in. Markets currently expect just under two cuts this year. Diverging rate outlooks for the two central banks, shaped largely by the contrasting inflation trajectories, would put the squeeze on dollar-rupee forward premiums, which reflect the U.S.-India interest rate differential. Line-chart depicting trajectories of U.S. and India's consumer price inflation data \"The odds of another rate cut have increased in India and inflation will likely fall below 2% in July, so these bets will rise going into the August meeting.

On Wednesday, dollar-rupee forward premiums were a tad lower, with the one-year implied yield down 2 basis points at 1.96%. The odds of U.S. rate cuts are \"going lower, while India's rate cut chances are rising.

The new category of investment funds were first announced last year as a way to offer sophisticated investors a wider range of options. Sign up here. Under the new rules, which kicked in on April 1, Indian mutual funds can now offer long-short equity funds - where fund managers take both long- and short-positions - under a new category called \"Specialised Investment Fund\" (SIF) with a minimum investment size of 1 million rupees ($11,663.51). CICI Prudential Mutual Fund , Quant Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual fund and ITI Mutual Fund are already approved to launch the product, according to public disclosures and spokespeople of these firms. The CEOs of Edelweiss Mutual Fund and Mirae Asset Investment Managers, a unit of South Korea's Mirae Asset Financial Group, are awaiting approval to launch a hybrid long-short fund and an equity long-short fund respectively, they confirmed to Reuters. Nippon India mutual fund is awaiting approval to launch a long-short fund. \"We see a lot of potential in this category similar to what we have seen in alternative investment funds who have been able to amass assets with these long-short strategies,\" said Jatinder Pal Singh, CEO of ITI Mutual Fund. India's 48 asset managers manage 72.20 trillion rupees in assets. Hedge funds and quant firms such as AlphaGrep Investment Management, Abakkus Asset Management, Carnelian Capital, and Ask Investment Managers have applied for mutual fund licences, a prerequisite for launching SIFs, executives at these firms said, declining to be named. The funds did not respond to Reuters emails seeking details. SIFs allow fund managers more independence to structure their funds, said Ashish Gupta, chief investment officer at Axis Mutual Fund, also awaiting regulatory approval to launch SIFs. INSTITUTIONAL PARTICIPATION IN DERIVATIVES These funds are also permitted to trade derivatives and could help increase institutional participation in the derivatives market, where the regulator is seeking to widen the investor base and reduce speculation. \"Potentially this could help in reducing the speculative nature of options trading but would depend on strategies being rolled out and how much assets they get,\" Gupta said. lobal trading firms have increased their presence in India's growing derivatives market in the last year, but institutional participation from Indian funds is limited.

India's IPO market had its best-ever year in 2024, with $20.5 billion raised, second only to the U.S., riding high on money inflows from domestic investors who have become wealthier on growth in the world's fifth-largest economy and were optimistic about more economic growth.

Other major offerings in the pipeline are LG Electronics India's $1.8 billion IPO, and issues from JSW Cement and defence equipment maker SMPP worth around $470 million each, they added. JSW's offering could come in late July or early August, according to one banker. The timing of the other two was less clear.

The quality controls have faced a legal challenge from trade bodies in India, including the BME and the Bombay Non-Ferrous Metals Association. The government has defended the quality control order in court against claims that it would lead to supply shortages and create a supply monopoly. The BME said all five domestic licensees use copper cathodes entirely for their own consumption. \"As for foreign ... licensees, four of the 10 do not supply copper cathodes at all, offering only ingots or semi-finished forms,\" the BME said in a statement to Reuters. Among the 10 foreign suppliers who have secured certification under the new rules, seven are from Japan, two from Malaysia, and one from Austria, the Indian government said last month. Japan accounts for about two-thirds of India's refined copper imports, followed by Tanzania and Mozambique.

REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Photo Summary June CPI at 2.10% vs estimates of 2.5% June food inflation fell 1.06% vs a 0.99% rise in May CPI lowest since January 2019 NEW DELHI, July 14 (Reuters) - India's annual retail inflation (INCPIY=ECI) , opens new tab slowed to a more than six-year low of 2.10% in June, near the lower range of the central bank's tolerance band, as food prices continued to ease, making a case for further interest rate cuts. This was lower than the 2.5% estimated by economists in a Reuters poll. Retail inflation was at 2.82% in May. Sign up here. Food prices have been the main driver for slowing inflation this year as adequate rainfall boosted output of agricultural goods. Inflation in food items - which account for nearly half of the retail inflation index - fell 1.06% in June from a 0.99% rise in the previous month. Vegetable prices fell 19% year-on-year, compared to an 13.7% fall in May. \"CPI inflation edged further down in June on the back of lower food prices,\" said Sakshi Gupta, an economist at HDFC Bank. The headline and food inflation in June was the lowest since January, 2019, the government's statistical department said in its release. The line chart shows India's retail and food inflation for June 2025 The Reserve Bank of India is mandated to not let inflation fall below 2% or rise above 6% for three consecutive quarters. Prices of cereals rose 3.73% on-year against a 4.77% increase in May, while those of pulses declined 11.76% compared to a 8.22% fall in May. The heat map shows the inflation of various components of India's retail inflation coloured based on the the central bank's inflation target range of 2% to 6%. Easing inflation has given room to the RBI to focus on growth. In June, the central bank cut its repo rate by a larger-than-expected 50 basis points. It also trimmed its fiscal 2026 projection for retail inflation to 3.7% from 4% earlier, citing a strong harvest and the early arrival of monsoon rains. \"Given this print and ongoing momentum in food inflation, the annual average inflation for FY26 is likely to be lower than 3.7%,\" Gupta said. RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said in an interview to a national daily that inflation below the central bank's current projection could open up policy space and that the RBI will strike the right growth-inflation balance. \"While comfortable inflation opens room for further monetary easing, we expect the RBI to maintain a pause in the coming one-two meetings and remain watchful of the transmission ahead along with global uncertainties,\" said Upasna Bhardwaj, economist at Kotak Mahidra Bank. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy and is an indicator of domestic demand, was at 4.4%-4.5% in June from 4.17%-4.20% in the previous month, according to three economists.

Intel is set to report its sixth consecutive net loss on Thursday, while revenue is expected to drop for a fifth straight quarter, according to estimates from LSEG data. Sign up here.

Rival Nvidia has leaped ahead in the booming artificial intelligence chip industry, while rival AMD (AMD.O) , opens new tab has been gaining share in Intel's mainstay personal computer and server semiconductor markets. CEO Tan has been focusing on a next-generation chipmaking process called 14A to win big external customers, shifting away from 18A, a technology that his predecessor Pat Gelsinger had spent billions of dollars to develop. Such a move could lead to a big writedown, an expense that would surely displease investors even as Intel has signaled that the new technology will help it be more competitive against Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) , opens new tab , the world's biggest chipmaking factory.

    "full_text": "Summary Mines loaded last month, raising fears of blockade Mining would have severely harmed global commerce U.S. has not ruled out possibility that loading the mines was a ruse WASHINGTON, July 1 (Reuters) - The Iranian military loaded naval mines onto vessels in the Persian Gulf last month, a move that intensified concerns in Washington that Tehran was gearing up to blockade the Strait of Hormuz following Israel's strikes on sites across Iran , according to two U.S. officials. The previously unreported preparations, which were detected by U.S. intelligence, occurred some time after Israel launched its initial missile attack against Iran on June 13, said the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters. Sign up here. The loading of the mines - which have not been deployed in the strait - suggests that Tehran may have been serious about closing one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, a move that would have escalated an already-spiraling conflict and severely hobbled global commerce. loading About one-fifth of global oil and gas shipments pass through the Strait of Hormuz and a blockage would likely have spiked world energy prices. Global benchmark oil prices have instead fallen more than 10% since the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, driven in part by relief that the conflict did not trigger significant disruptions in the oil trade. On June 22, shortly after the U.S. bombed three of Iran's key nuclear sites in a bid to cripple Tehran's nuclear program, Iran's parliament reportedly backed a measure to block the strait. That decision was not binding, and it was up to Iran's Supreme National Security Council to make a final decision on the closure, Iran's Press TV said at the time. Iran has over the years threatened to close the strait but has never followed through on that threat. Reuters was not able to determine precisely when during the Israel-Iran air war Tehran loaded the mines, which - if deployed - would have effectively stopped ships from moving through the key thoroughfare. It is also unclear if the mines have since been unloaded. The sources did not disclose how the United States determined that the mines had been put on the Iranian vessels, but such intelligence is typically gathered through satellite imagery, clandestine human sources or a combination of both methods. Asked for comment about Iran's preparations, a White House official said: \"Thanks to the President’s brilliant execution of Operation Midnight Hammer, successful campaign against the Houthis, and maximum pressure campaign, the Strait of Hormuz remains open, freedom of navigation has been restored, and Iran has been significantly weakened.\" The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Iranian mission at the United Nations also did not respond to requests for comment. KEY THOROUGHFARE The two officials said the U.S. government has not ruled out the possibility that loading the mines was a ruse. The Iranians could have prepared the mines to convince Washington that Tehran was serious about closing the strait, but without intending to do so, the officials said. Iran's military could have also simply been making necessary preparations in the event that Iran's leaders gave the order. The Strait of Hormuz lies between Oman and Iran and links the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman to the south and the Arabian Sea beyond. It is 21 miles (34 km) wide at its narrowest point, with the shipping lane just 2 miles wide in either direction. OPEC members Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq export most of their crude via the strait, mainly to Asia. Qatar, among the world's biggest liquefied natural gas exporters, sends almost all of its LNG through the strait. Iran also exports most of its crude through the passage, which in theory limits Tehran's appetite to shut the strait. But Tehran has nonetheless dedicated significant resources to making sure it can do so if it deems necessary. As of 2019, Iran maintained more than 5,000 naval mines, which could be rapidly deployed with the help of small, high-speed boats, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency estimated at the time. The U.S. Fifth Fleet, which is based in Bahrain, is charged with protecting commerce in the region. The U.S. Navy has typically kept four mine countermeasure vessels, or MCM vessels, in Bahrain, though those ships are being replaced by another type of vessel called a littoral combat ship, or LCS, which also has anti-mine capabilities. All anti-mine ships had been temporarily removed from Bahrain in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran in anticipation of a potential retaliatory attack on Fifth Fleet headquarters. Ultimately, Iran's immediate retaliation was limited to a missile attack on a U.S. military base in nearby Qatar. U.S. officials, however, have not ruled out further retaliatory measures by Iran.

On Wednesday, Israel launched airstrikes in Damascus and hit government forces in the south, demanding they withdraw and saying that Israel aimed to protect Syrian Druze - part of a small but influential minority that also has members in Lebanon and Israel. Sign up here. \"We call upon Druze, Bedouins, and Sunnis to put down their weapons and together with other minorities build a new and united Syrian identity,\" Tom Barrack, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey, said in a post on X. Barrack said that Israel and Syria agreed to the ceasefire supported by Turkey, Jordan and neighbors. The Israeli embassy in Washington and Syrian consulate in Canada did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Syria's Sweida province has been engulfed by nearly a week of violence triggered by clashes between Bedouin fighters and Druze factions. Earlier on Friday, an Israeli official said Israel agreed to allow Syrian forces limited access to the Sweida area of southern Syria for the next two days. The Syrian presidency said late on Friday that authorities would deploy a force in the south dedicated to ending the clashes, in coordination with political and security measures to restore stability and prevent the return of violence. Damascus earlier this week dispatched government troops to quell the fighting, but they were accused of carrying out widespread violations against the Druze and were hit by Israeli strikes before withdrawing under a truce agreed on Wednesday. Israel had repeatedly said it would not allow Syrian troops to deploy to the country's south, but on Friday it said it would grant them a brief window to end renewed clashes there. \"In light of the ongoing instability in southwest Syria, Israel has agreed to allow limited entry of the (Syrian) internal security forces into Sweida district for the next 48 hours,\" the official, who declined to be named, told reporters. Describing Syria's new rulers as barely disguised jihadists, Israel has vowed to shield the area's Druze community from attack, encouraged by calls from Israel's own Druze minority. It carried out more strikes on Sweida in the early hours of Friday. The U.S. intervened to help secure the earlier truce between government forces and Druze fighters, and the White House said on Thursday that it appeared to be holding. Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has worked to establish warmer ties with the U.S., accused Israel of trying to fracture Syria and promised to protect its Druze minority. Reuters reporters saw a convoy of units from Syria's interior ministry stopped on a road in Daraa province, which lies directly east of Sweida. A security source told Reuters that forces were awaiting a final green light to enter Sweida. But thousands of Bedouin fighters were still streaming into Sweida on Friday, the Reuters reporters said, prompting fears among residents that violence would continue unabated. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said it had documented 321 deaths in fighting since Sunday, among them medical personnel, women and children. It said they included field executions by all sides. Syria's minister for emergencies said more than 500 wounded had been treated and hundreds of families had been evacuated out of the city. 'NOTHING AT ALL' Clashes continued in the north and west of Sweida province, according to residents and Ryan Marouf, the head of local news outlet Sweida24. Residents said they had little food and water, and that electricity had been cut to the city for several days. \"For four days, there has been no electricity, no fuel, no food, no drink, nothing at all,\" said Mudar, a 28-year-old resident of Sweida who asked to be identified only by his first name out of fear of reprisals. \"The clashes haven't stopped,\" he said, adding that \"we can't get news easily because there's barely internet or phone coverage.\" The head of the U.N. human rights office urged Syria's interim authorities to ensure accountability for what it said are credible reports of widespread rights violations during the fighting, including summary executions and kidnappings, the office said in a statement. At least 13 people were unlawfully killed in one recorded incident on Tuesday when affiliates of the interim authorities opened fire at a family gathering, the OHCHR said. Six men were summarily executed near their homes the same day. The UN refugee agency on Friday urged all sides to allow humanitarian access , which it said had been curtailed by the violence. Israel's deep distrust of Syria's new Islamist-led leadership appears to be at odds with the United States, which said it did not support the recent Israeli strikes on Syria.

The Israeli military said the airstrikes targeted training camps used by elite Hezbollah fighters and warehouses it used to store weapons in the Bekaa Valley region. Sign up here. The airstrikes were the deadliest on the area since a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel last November. Bachir Khodr, governor of the Bekaa region, said seven of the dead were Syrian nationals. Israel dealt Hezbollah heavy blows in last year's conflict, killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah along with other commanders and destroying much of its arsenal. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said Tuesday's strikes sent a \"clear message\" to Hezbollah, accusing it of planning to rebuild the capability to raid Israel through the elite Radwan force. Israel \"will respond with maximum force to any attempt at rebuilding\", he said. He added that strikes were also a message to the Lebanese government, saying it was responsible for upholding the ceasefire agreement. Hezbollah condemned the Israeli attack on Bekaa Valley, describing it as a \"major escalation of ongoing Israeli aggression against Lebanon\". It made no mention in its statement on whether some of its fighters were killed in the strikes. There was no immediate public response from the Lebanese government. The United States has submitted a proposal to the Lebanese government aimed at securing Hezbollah's disarmament within four months in exchange for Israel halting air strikes and withdrawing troops from positions they still hold in south Lebanon.

The ministry said dozens of people were also wounded in the incident in northern Gaza. It was one of the highest reported death tolls among repeated recent cases in which aid seekers have been killed, including 36 on Saturday . Another six people were killed near another aid site in the south, it said. Sign up here. Israel's military said its troops had fired warning shots towards a crowd of thousands of people in northern Gaza on Sunday to remove what it said was \"an immediate threat\". It said initial findings suggested reported casualty figures were inflated, and it \"certainly does not intentionally target humanitarian aid trucks\". It did not immediately comment on the incident in the south. The U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) said that shortly after entering Gaza, a WFP convoy of 25 trucks carrying food aid encountered \"massive crowds of hungry civilians\" who then came under gunfire. \"WFP reiterates that any violence involving civilians seeking humanitarian aid is completely unacceptable,\" it said in a statement. A Hamas official told Reuters that the militant group was angered over the mounting deaths and the hunger crisis in the enclave, and that this could badly affect ceasefire talks underway in Qatar. In total, health authorities said 90 people had been killed by Israeli gunfire and airstrikes across the enclave on Sunday. DISPLACED GAZANS EVACUATE After Israel's military dropped leaflets urging people to evacuate from neighbourhoods in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah, residents said Israeli planes struck three houses in the area. Dozens of families began leaving their homes, carrying some of their belongings. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans have been sheltering in the Deir al-Balah area. Israel's military said it had not entered the districts subject to the evacuation order during the current conflict and that it was continuing \"to operate with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure in the area\". Israeli sources have said the reason the army has so far stayed out is because they suspect Hamas might be holding hostages there. At least 20 of the remaining 50 hostages in captivity in Gaza are believed to still be alive. Hostage families demanded an explanation from the army. \"Can anyone (promise) to us that this decision will not come at the cost of losing our loved ones?\" the families said in a statement. ACCELERATING STARVATION Much of Gaza has been reduced to a wasteland during more than 21 months of war and there are fears of accelerating starvation.

The United Nations also said on Sunday that civilians were starving and needed an urgent influx of aid. Pope Leo called for an end to the \"barbarity of war\" as he spoke of his profound pain over an Israeli strike on the sole Catholic church in Gaza that killed three people on Thursday. Gaza residents said it was becoming impossible to find essential food such as flour. The health ministry said at least 71 children had died of malnutrition during the war, and 60,000 others were suffering from symptoms of malnutrition. Later on Sunday, it said 18 people have died of hunger in the past 24 hours. Food prices have increased well beyond what most of the population of more than two million can afford. Several people who spoke to Reuters via chat apps said they either had one meal or no meal in the past 24 hours. \"As a father, I wake up in the early morning to look for food, for even a loaf of bread for my five children, but all in vain,\" said Ziad, a nurse. \"People who didn't die of bombs will die of hunger. We want an end to this war now, a truce, even for two months,\" he told Reuters. Others said they felt dizzy walking in the streets and that many fainted as they walked. Fathers leave tents to avoid questions by their children about what to eat. UNRWA, the U.N. refugee agency dedicated to Palestinians, demanded Israel allow more aid trucks into Gaza, saying it had enough food for the entire population for over three months which was not allowed in. Israel's military said that it \"views the transfer of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip as a matter of utmost importance, and works to enable and facilitate its entry in coordination with the international community\". TRUCE TALKS Some Palestinians suggested the move on Deir al-Balah might be an attempt to put pressure on Hamas to make more concessions in long-running ceasefire negotiations. Israel and Hamas are engaged in indirect talks in Doha aimed at reaching a 60-day truce and hostage deal, although there has been no sign of breakthrough. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza. The Israeli military campaign against Hamas in Gaza has since killed more than 58,000 Palestinians, according to health officials, displaced almost the entire population and plunged the enclave into a humanitarian crisis.

The petition was signed by 15 cabinet ministers and Amir Ohana, speaker of the Knesset, Israel's parliament. There was no immediate response from the prime minister's office. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, long a confidant of Netanyahu, did not sign the petition. He has been in Washington since Monday for talks on Iran and Gaza. \"We ministers and members of Knesset call for applying Israeli sovereignty and law immediately on Judea and Samaria,\" they wrote, using the biblical names for the West Bank captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Their petition cited Israel's recent achievements against both Iran and Iran's allies and the opportunity afforded by the strategic partnership with the U.S. and support of Trump. It said the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel demonstrated that the concept of Jewish settlement blocs alongside the establishment of a Palestinian state poses an existential threat to Israel. “The task must be completed, the existential threat removed from within, and another massacre in the heart of the country must be prevented,” the petition stated. Most countries regard Jewish settlements in the West Bank, many of which cut off Palestinian communities from one another, as a violation of international law. With each advance of Israeli settlements and roads, the West Bank becomes more fractured, further undermining prospects for a contiguous land on which Palestinians could build a sovereign state long envisaged in Middle East peacemaking. Israel's pro-settler politicians have been emboldened by the return to the White House of Trump, who has proposed Palestinians leave Gaza, a suggestion widely condemned across the Middle East and beyond.

The strikes hit the ports of Hodeidah, Ras Isa and Salif, as well as the Ras Qantib power plant on the coast, in response to repeated Houthi attacks on Israel, the military said. Sign up here. Hours later, Israel said two missiles were launched from Yemen. Attempts were made to intercept them, though the results were still under review. The Iran-aligned Houthi forces said they had fired missiles and drones at multiple targets in Israel in retaliation for the strikes on Yemen. The Israeli ambulance service said it had not received any calls regarding missile impacts or casualties following the launches from Yemen. Since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, the Houthis have fired at Israel and at shipping in the Red Sea, disrupting global trade, in what the group says are acts of solidarity with the Palestinians. Most of the dozens of missiles and drones fired toward Israel have been intercepted or fallen short. Israel has carried out a series of retaliatory strikes. Israel said its attacks on Monday also targeted a ship, the Galaxy Leader, which was seized by the Houthis in late 2023 and held in Ras Isa port. \"The Houthi terrorist regime's forces installed a radar system on the ship, and are using it to track vessels in international maritime space in order to promote the Houthi terrorist regime’s activities,\" the military said. The Houthi military spokesperson said the group's air defences had responded to the Israeli attack with \"a large number of domestically produced surface-to-air missiles\". Israel's military told residents to evacuate the three ports before it launched its attacks. Residents of Hodeidah told Reuters that the strikes on the power station had knocked out electricity. There was no immediate information on casualties. The Israeli assault comes hours after a ship was attacked off of Hodeidah and the ship's crew abandoned it as it took on water. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but security firm Ambrey said the vessel fit the typical profile of a Houthi target. The Houthis, who control northern Yemen including the capital Sanaa, are one of the last pro-Iran armed groups still standing in the Middle East after Israel severely hurt other allies of Tehran: Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Iran itself in a 12-day air war last month. Under the direction of leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the group has grown into an army of tens of thousands of fighters and acquired armed drones and ballistic missiles. Saudi Arabia and the West say the arms come from Iran, though Tehran denies this.

    "full_text": "ROME, July 28 (Reuters) - Italy's working age population is set to shrink by more than a fifth over the next 25 years, national statistics agency Istat said on Monday, highlighting the country's severe demographic challenges. Italy is battling with a falling birth rate and a shrinking population. Last year new births dropped to a record low of around 370,000, and the population fell by 37,000 to 58.93 million, continuing a decade-long trend. Sign up here. In its latest demographic forecast, Istat predicted that the number of people in the 15-64 age group would fall from 37.4 million in 2024 to 29.7 million in 2050, with their share of the total resident population falling to 54.3% from 63.5%. In the same period, the percentage of residents over the age of 65 is projected to rise to 34.6% of the total, from 24.3% currently, and the share of children up to the age of 14 to fall to 11.2% from 12.2%. Italy's long-declining birth rate is considered a national emergency. But despite Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and her predecessors' pledges to tackle the issues, no one has so far been able to halt the drop. Istat estimated on Monday that Italy's resident population would fall to 54.7 million by 2050, although it added that its forecast had a large margin of variability and uncertainty linked to migration trends. In a report last year, Scope Ratings said Italy's demographics were the worst in Europe in terms of economic growth potential between 2023 and 2040, with a rapidly ageing population posing a threat to strained public finances.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab TOKYO, July 26 (Reuters) - Japan's $550 billion investment package agreed in this week's U.S. tariff deal could help finance a Taiwanese firm building semiconductor plants in the U.S., Japan's top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa said on Saturday. Japan agreed to the sweeping U.S.-bound investment initiative, which includes equity, loans and guarantees, in exchange for lower tariffs on its exports to the U.S. Sign up here. However, the structure of the scheme remains unclear. \"Japan, the United States, and like-minded countries are working together to build supply chains in sectors critical to economic security,\" Akazawa told public broadcaster NHK. To that end, he said projects eligible for financing under the package are not limited to U.S. or Japanese firms. \"For example, if a Taiwanese chipmaker builds a plant in the U.S. and uses Japanese components or tailors its products to meet Japanese needs, that's fine too,\" he said, without specifying companies. The U.S. is significantly reliant on Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) , opens new tab for advanced chip manufacturing, raising economic security concerns due to geographic proximity to China. TSMC announced plans for a $100 billion U.S. investment with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in March, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants in the state of Arizona, one of which is up and running. Japan will use state-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) for the investments. A recent law revision has enabled JBIC to finance foreign companies deemed critical to Japan's supply chains. Akazawa told NHK that equity investment would account for just about 1-2% of the $550 billion, suggesting that the bulk will come in the form of loans and guarantees. When asked about the White House statement that the U.S. would retain 90% of the profits from the package, he clarified that the figure refers only to returns on equity investment, which would represent a small fraction of the total. While Japan initially hoped to secure half of the returns, a loss from the concession on the profit-sharing would be marginal compared to the roughly 10 trillion yen ($67.72 billion) in tariff costs that could be avoided under the deal, he said. He added that Japan aims to deploy the $550 billion investments during Trump's current term.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Habba's temporary appointment as NJ's US Attorney nearing expiration Federal court declined to install her permanently Deputy Attorney General accuses judges of harboring a \"left-wing agenda\" WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department accused a panel of New Jersey federal court judges of political motives for declining to permanently appoint Republican President Donald Trump 's former lawyer Alina Habba as the state's top federal prosecutor. The judges on the U.S. District Court in New Jersey named Desiree Grace, the second highest-ranking official in the U.S. attorney's office, to replace Habba on Tuesday. Hours later Attorney General Pam Bondi said Grace had been removed. Sign up here. \"This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges — especially when they threaten the President’s core Article II powers,\" Bondi wrote in a post on X, referring to Trump's authority under the U.S. Constitution. Federal law allows district courts to intervene if an interim U.S. attorney has not received Senate approval within 120 days. Democrats condemned the removal of Grace. \"The firing of a career public servant, lawfully appointed by the court, is another blatant attempt to intimidate anyone that doesn't agree with them and undermine judicial independence,\" Democratic U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim from New Jersey said in a joint statement. Habba has been serving as New Jersey's interim U.S. attorney since her appointment by Trump in March, but was limited by law to 120 days in office unless the court agreed to keep her in place. The U.S. Senate has not yet acted on her formal nomination to the role, submitted by Trump this month. Habba and Grace could not be immediately reached for comment. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said in a statement on X that the U.S. District Court in New Jersey was trying to \"force\" Habba out of her job before her term expires at 11:59 p.m. on Friday. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York last week declined to keep Trump's U.S. attorney pick John Sarcone in place after his 120-day term neared expiration. Sarcone managed to stay in the office after the Justice Department found a workaround by naming him as \"special attorney to the attorney general,\" according to the New York Times. The Justice Department cannot make a similar arrangement for Habba, however, because federal law prohibits the government from appointing someone to serve in an acting capacity if the individual was already nominated by the president to serve in that role. Habba's brief tenure as New Jersey's interim U.S. attorney included the filing of multiple legal actions against Democratic elected officials. Her office brought criminal charges against Democratic U.S. Representative LaMonica McIver, as she and other members of Congress and Newark's Democratic mayor, Ras Baraka, tried to visit an immigration detention center. The scene grew chaotic after immigration agents tried to arrest Baraka for trespassing, and McIver's elbows appeared to make brief contact with an immigration officer. Habba's office charged McIver with two counts of assaulting and impeding a law enforcement officer. McIver has pleaded not guilty Habba's office did not follow Justice Department rules which require prosecutors to seek permission from the Public Integrity Section before bringing criminal charges against a member of Congress for conduct related to their official duties. Habba's office also charged Baraka, but later dropped the case, prompting a federal magistrate judge to criticize her office for its handling of the matter. Until March, Habba had never worked as a prosecutor. She has represented Trump in a variety of civil litigation, including a trial in which a jury found Trump liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of raping her in the mid-1990s in a department store dressing room. In 2023, a federal judge in Florida sanctioned Trump and Habba and ordered them to pay $1 million for filing a frivolous lawsuit which alleged that Hillary Clinton and others conspired to damage Trump's reputation in the investigation into Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

The death of blogger Albert Ojwang in police custody last month has given the protests fresh impetus, fuelling anger against the authorities and bringing hundreds onto the streets. Sign up here. A Reuters reporter saw police fire at advancing protesters in the Nairobi suburb of Kangemi, with one man later lying motionless on the road with a bleeding wound. The suburb's Eagle Nursing Home said six people had been admitted with injuries, and that two had died from gunshot wounds. A source at Kenyatta National Hospital said it was treating 24 injured people, but did not elaborate on their injuries. ARMED GANGS ALONGSIDE POLICE Kenya's police said 11 people had died, while 52 officers had been injured. It did not say who was responsible for the killings. \"Preliminary reports indicate fatalities, injuries, damage to motor vehicles, and several incidents of looting,\" police said in a statement. Law enforcers have been deploying heavily in Nairobi since youth-led protests in June 2024 that initially focused on tax hikes but expanded to cover issues such as corruption, police brutality and unexplained disappearances of government critics. Police used tear gas and water cannons on Monday to disperse hundreds of demonstrators advancing along a road connecting Kangemi to downtown Nairobi. Hours later, protesters and police scuffled, and a Reuters reporter saw police opening fire as the crowd charged at them. The government-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) said it saw \"numerous hooded officers, not in uniform, travelling in unmarked vehicles\".

Local media said there had been demonstrations in the towns of Nyeri, Embu and the lakeside city of Nakuru, where half a dozen police on horseback dispersed stone-throwing protesters. Police had blocked major roads leading into Nairobi and restricted traffic within the city, leaving streets deserted but for the demonstrators, who arrived on foot. Most schools and at least one shopping mall were shut in anticipation of trouble. 'HIGH ALERT' Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen, who last month described the protests as \"terrorism disguised as dissent\", said on Sunday that the government was committed to protecting life and property. \"Our security agencies are on high alert to deal decisively with criminals and other elements of ill intent who may seek to infiltrate peaceful processions to cause havoc, mayhem, or destruction of property,\" he said. Activists rally every July 7 to mark the day in 1990 when opponents of then-president Daniel Arap Moi launched a bid to turn Kenya into a multi-party democracy. The protest is called \"Saba Saba\" - \"Seven Seven\" in Kiswahili - because of the date. Those protests paved the way two years later for the first multi-party elections in more than two decades. The death of 31-year-old Ojwang, a blogger and teacher, has focused public anger, sparking a string of demonstrations last month. On June 25, according to the Commission, 19 people lost their lives nationwide in demonstrations to protest against Ojwang's death and mark the first anniversary of rallies that culminated in the storming of parliament. Six people including three police officers have been charged with murder over Ojwang's death. All have pleaded 'Not guilty'.

The transportation division of SMART, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, said it plans to oppose , opens new tab the merger when it comes before the Surface Transportation Board for review. SMART represents 230,000 members across several sectors including transportation, construction, and manufacturing. \"We approach this development with measured skepticism rooted in the real-world impact such consolidation could have on rail workers, safety, service quality, and the long-term health of the freight rail industry,\" the union said in a statement. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said in announcing the deal that they intend to preserve union jobs and aim to be the safest railroad in the country. The deal, announced earlier on Tuesday , drew mixed reactions from Republicans in Congress. U.S. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, said he was concerned. “I don’t know enough to know, but if they’re concerned, I’m concerned,” Hawley told Reuters, referring to SMART, which endorsed him for reelection in 2024, citing his support for rail safety. “It's going to be a great deal for America, it’s going to be a great deal for Nebraska,” Senator Pete Ricketts, a Republican from Nebraska, where Union Pacific is based, told Reuters. Union Pacific shares were down 3.3% at $221.64 on Tuesday afternoon, while Norfolk Southern shares were down 3.4% at $276.97.

Union Pacific has had the most accidents, injuries, and fatalities in the industry in recent years, and has shown a willingness to lay off workers including engineers and conductors even during periods of stability, SMART's Transportation Division said. The union also raised concern that Union Pacific's practice of leasing out its infrastructure could affect service quality.

Shippers and communities deserve more than a monopoly in disguise,\" SMART said. MIXED BAG FOR SHIPPING U.S. railroads have merged from thousands in the late 1800s to just a few players today. A merger of this scale would be a landmark moment for U.S. supply chains, as the resulting railroad would account for almost half of all containerized rail traffic in the country, said Jess Dankert, the Retail Industry Leaders Association's vice president of supply chain. \"There are two elements to be watched closely: the promise of greater efficiency but also the risk of increased costs,\" Dankert said. \"A lot of the consolidation that has occurred in the rail industry has resulted, at times, in higher rail rates and a decrease in service,\" said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition. \"We want people competing for our business, that's good for us,\" Steenhoek said. At the busiest U.S. seaport in Los Angeles, about 25% of cargo enters or leaves the docks via rail - work that is split roughly equally between Union Pacific and Berkshire Hathaway-owned BNSF, said Gene Seroka, the port's executive director. Seroka supports the proposed merger, saying it has the potential to create a seamless service that could reduce costs and improve service, in part by reducing the number of times a rail car is handed off to a new train operator. Quick cargo clearance means the port can process more cargo. When it comes to supply chains, minimizing cargo hand-offs that add time and potential complications is vital. \"It doesn't like to be passed around like a baton in a relay race,\" Steenhoek said.

The company reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales, with its core fashion and leather division losing further ground as the group struggles to shake off consumer fatigue Sign up here. Arnault has heavily lobbied EU leaders to ease tensions with the Trump administration. \"I’m pushing as much as I can for us to reach an agreement with the Americans,\" Arnault told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Thursday, in which he announced plans for a new factory in Texas by 2027. Arnault opened a Louis Vuitton factory in Texas in 2019 during Trump's first term, which was seen as having helped the group avoid tariffs on luxury goods. Reuters reported in April that the plant has been plagued by a host of operational problems. Finance Chief Cecile Cabanis said she was confident trade talks between the EU and the Trump administration would deliver good news soon. Asked how LVMH would view a potential tariff rate of 15% for exports to the United States, Cabanis said that would be an \"overall good outcome for the general mood of our clients\". With the exception of wines and spirits, the company still has room to draw on the pricing power of its brands - like Bulgari jewellery and fashion houses Dior and Celine. LVMH's sales for the second quarter to the end of June were down 4% to 19.5 billion euros ($22.95 billion), falling short of a consensus forecast for a 3% decline. Sales at the group's fashion and leather division, accounting for the bulk of profits, were down 9%, below expectations for a 6% drop. HOPE IN CHINA In China, where a real estate crisis has dampened appetite for luxury goods, there was \"tangible improvement\", Cabanis said. The success of Louis Vuitton's new store in Shanghai, a giant ship, demonstrated the brand still had the clout to attract worldwide attention, she said. Most analysts still view the industry's extended downturn as cyclical, induced in part by the prolonged slump in China, bouts of inflation and as yet unresolved trade tensions.

    "full_text": "Summary Concerns raised over Trump envoy pick's views on Islam, support for Israel Adams promotes his love of steak, cheerleaders, muscle cars and beauty pageants Refusal could provoke U.S. retaliation amid trade talks, analyst says KUALA LUMPUR, July 16 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s government is facing mounting calls to reject a self-styled \"alpha male\" influencer picked by President Donald Trump to be U.S. ambassador, in what could risk damaging ties at a critical time of tariff talks between the two countries. The White House has proposed 40-year-old author and outspoken political commentator Nick Adams to the Senate as its nominee for ambassador to Malaysia, triggering concerns in the Muslim-majority nation over Adams' views on Islam and support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza, among other sensitive topics. Sign up here. No date is set for the Senate vote, but Adams is expected to be approved, with the Republican-held Senate green-lighting every Trump nominee since he became president in January. Adams, a naturalised U.S. citizen originally from Australia, has an outsized persona on social media and is known for his appeal among young males in the \"manosphere\", an online space for men's issues. He lists interests including a love for hot dogs, steak, muscle cars, and restaurant chain Hooters, where servers wear revealing uniforms. In posts on online platform X, Adams has railed against alleged efforts to \"teach Islam in schools\" and described those expressing solidarity with Palestinians as supporters of terrorism. The posts have sparked outrage in Malaysia, which has a majority of mostly Muslim ethnic Malays alongside significant ethnic Chinese and ethnic Indian minorities of other faiths. Malaysia has also long supported the Palestinian cause, with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim rejecting what he described as Western pressure to condemn Palestinian militant group Hamas. The youth wing of Anwar's People's Justice Party said this week it would submit a memorandum of protest to the U.S. embassy in Kuala Lumpur against Adams' proposed appointment as envoy, adding any rejection \"should not be misconstrued as hostility but rather seen as a necessary measure to safeguard the integrity of bilateral relations.\" Mohamed Sukri Omar, a member of Islamic opposition party PAS, said in a statement the appointment would be \"an open insult towards the sensitivities of the Malaysian people,\" while a group representing 20 pro-Palestine organisations in Malaysia urged the government to reject Adams. Malaysian government spokesperson Fahmi Fadzil said on Tuesday Adams' appointment had not yet been raised in cabinet, which has the authority to accept new diplomatic appointments. Shahriman Lockman of Malaysia's Institute of Strategic and International Studies, said protests from Muslim groups and ruling bloc allies could be too politically costly for Anwar's government to ignore, although Adams may be a useful conduit during trade talks due to his perceived closeness to Trump. Refusing Adams could also provoke retaliation from Trump at a time when Malaysia faces pressure to make trade concessions in exchange for lowering a potentially hefty 25% U.S. tariff, he said. \"There’s no elegant solution here. It’s damned if you do, damned if you don’t,\" Shahriman said. Adams' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an X post on July 10, he thanked Trump for the nomination, describing it as \"the honour of a lifetime\". Trump described Adams on Truth Social as \"an incredible Patriot and very successful entrepreneur, whose love of, and devotion to, our Great Country is an inspiration.\" When contacted for comment, the U.S. embassy in Kuala Lumpur pointed to remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a visit to Malaysia last week. Rubio said he supported Adams' nomination and looked forward to his confirmation. 'TONE MATTERS' Former diplomats say Malaysia was unlikely to reject Adams' appointment outright, but could make its objections known through informal channels or by delaying its approval. \"That would send a subtle but clear diplomatic signal: we value the bilateral relationship, but we also expect a standard of decorum, cultural sensitivity, and respect appropriate to such a posting,\" said Ilango Karuppannan, a retired former Malaysian ambassador who was once deputy chief of mission in Washington. While concerns over Adams' appointment were unlikely to have a direct impact on trade negotiations, \"the broader tone of the bilateral relationship always matters,\" he said. \"A smooth, professional handling of this nomination can help ensure those trade discussions stay on track, while an avoidable public clash might risk unnecessary complications,\" Karuppannan said. Former Malaysia Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah, a member of the largely ethnic Malay opposition bloc Perikatan Nasional, said Malaysia should stand firm in upholding its values despite Adams' relationship with Trump. \"Yes it would be good to have a U.S. ambassador who is very close to Trump... but you cannot compromise on certain principles,\" he said. Tricia Yeoh, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham Malaysia, said Adams' success as envoy would be highly dependent on his ability to win the trust of Malaysia's political and policy leadership. \"If the comments he has previously made on social media are accurate depictions of his position on sociopolitical matters, he might find it challenging to do so, especially if he intends to make these positions publicly and explicitly known,\" she said.

The withdrawal follows last week's decision to remove about half of the 4,000 National Guard troops also sent to Los Angeles. Sign up here. \"With stability returning to Los Angeles, the Secretary has directed the redeployment of the 700 Marines whose presence sent a clear message: Lawlessness will not be tolerated,\" said Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell. Trump deployed the Marines and California National Guard troops to Los Angeles in June, against the wishes of Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, to quell protests triggered by immigration raids on workplaces by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Despite legal challenges, a U.S. appeals court let Trump retain control of California's National Guard. Trump's decision to send troops into Los Angeles prompted a national debate about the use of the military on U.S. soil and inflamed political tension in the country's second-most-populous city. The Pentagon has defended the deployment, saying that safeguarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents ensures they can do their jobs, and praised the Marines on Monday. \"Their rapid response, unwavering discipline, and unmistakable presence were instrumental in restoring order and upholding the rule of law,\" Parnell said. Trump has vowed to deport millions of people in the country illegally and has executed raids at work sites including farms that had been largely exempted from enforcement during his first term. The administration has faced dozens of lawsuits across the country challenging its tactics. Trump has increasingly turned to the military in his immigration crackdown. In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles, thousands of active-duty troops have been deployed to the border with Mexico, and the Pentagon has created military zones in the border area. The zones are intended to allow the Trump administration to use troops to detain migrants without invoking the 1807 Insurrection Act that empowers a president to deploy the U.S. military to suppress events such as civil disorder.

The figure also undershot the 3.64% expected by economists polled by Reuters. The slowdown in inflation \"shows that the Bank of Mexico has room to keep cutting interest rates,\" President Claudia Sheinbaum said at her regular morning press conference.

Consumer prices in Mexico rose 4.32% in the year through June, according to national statistics agency INEGI, roughly in line with the 4.31% expected by economists in a Reuters poll and slowing from the 4.42% reported in the previous month. Sign up here. Mexico's central bank, also known as Banxico, has an inflation target of 3%, plus or minus one percentage point. In contrast, 12-month core inflation, often seen as a better gauge of price trends because it strips out highly volatile food and energy prices, accelerated to 4.24% from 4.06% in May, hitting its highest level since April of last year. The core inflationary pressures have stirred uncertainty regarding Banxico's future decisions on borrowing costs in Latin America's second-largest economy. \"Core inflation remains sticky, with persistent upward pressure from housing, food services and a seasonal jump in airfares, likely keeping some Banxico board members uneasy,\" said Andres Abadia, chief Latin America economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. The Bank of Mexico lowered its benchmark rate by 50 basis points last month, though the decision by the central bank's five-member governing board was not unanimous. In its decision, the bank's board of governors adjusted its forward guidance, dropping previous references to further 50 basis point cuts. Instead, it said it would continue to assess \"additional cuts\". Deputy Governor Jonathan Heath voted to hold the rate last month after previously calling for a more cautious approach until inflation shows a more sustained downward trajectory. July's inflation is expected to come in under 4%, meeting the upper end of the central bank's target range, Actinver analysts said in a note after Wednesday's inflation report. \"We anticipate that the Mexican central bank could cut its benchmark rate on two more occasions this year. We project that these cuts will occur in August and September, both cuts of 25 basis points,\" they added. In June alone, headline consumer prices were up 0.28%, according to INEGI, while the closely watched core index stood at 0.39%, both in line with market forecasts.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Aug 1 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday revived part of a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk's X of becoming a haven for child exploitation, though the court said the platform deserves broad immunity from claims over objectionable content. While rejecting some claims, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said X, formerly Twitter, must face a claim it was negligent by failing to promptly report a video containing explicit images of two underage boys to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Sign up here. The case predated Musk's 2022 purchase of Twitter. A trial judge had dismissed the case in December 2023. X's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk was not a defendant. One plaintiff, John Doe 1, said he was 13 when he and a friend, John Doe 2, were lured on SnapChat into providing nude photos of themselves to someone John Doe 1 thought was a 16-year-old girl at his school. The SnapChat user was actually a child pornography trafficker who blackmailed the plaintiffs into providing additional explicit photos. Those images were later compiled into a video that was posted on Twitter. According to court papers, Twitter took nine days after learning about the content to take it down and report it to NCMEC, following more than 167,000 views, court papers showed. Circuit Judge Danielle Forrest said section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from liability over user content, didn't shield X from the negligence claim once it learned about the pornography. \"The facts alleged here, coupled with the statutory 'actual knowledge' requirement, separates the duty to report child pornography to NCMEC from Twitter's role as a publisher,\" she wrote for a three-judge panel. X must also face a claim its infrastructure made it too difficult to report child pornography. It was found immune from claims it knowingly benefited from sex trafficking, and created search features that \"amplify\" child pornography posts. Dani Pinter, a lawyer at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, which represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement: \"We look forward to discovery and ultimately trial against X to get justice and accountability.\" The case is Doe 1 et al v Twitter Inc et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 24-177.

    "full_text": "Summary Companies CEO contenders to present to board meeting in London this week - sources Announcement could come as soon as later this month - source Rio's share price has underperformed major mining peers during current CEO's tenure MELBOURNE/LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto's (RIO.AX) , opens new tab (RIO.L) , opens new tab new CEO, who could be announced as soon as this month, should be open to transformative merger and acquisition deals as well as sharpening productivity and cost cuts, said two people aware of the chair's priorities. The world's biggest iron ore miner is in the later stages of picking a new chief executive through an internal and external search process after it surprised shareholders in May by announcing Jakob Stausholm would step down after 4-1/2 years. Sign up here. Finalists for the top job will make their pitches to the board in London this week, according to two other sources familiar with the search process, and an appointment could be announced as soon as late July, one of those sources said. Chair Dominic Barton's preference for the new CEO to be open to large-scale deals and the timing of the board presentations have not been reported previously. Internal candidates include Simon Trott, who has been the chief executive of its iron ore division since 2021, Bold Baatar, its chief commercial officer, as well as aluminium division head Jerome Pecresse, Reuters reported in May. Chief Technical Officer Mark Davies is also a candidate, said a fifth source. The sources all spoke on condition of anonymity because the search process is confidential. Rio, which is scheduled to release its half-year results on July 30, declined to comment. Barton, Trott, Baatar, Pecresse and Davies did not respond to requests for comment. 'BIG TICKET M&A' Since Stausholm's departure was announced, Barton has met with stakeholders to discuss the abrupt changing of the guard. The two people privy to conversations outlining Barton's priorities around a new CEO said he floated the idea of \"big ticket M&A\" with another mining major if sufficient value could be found. Rio was approached by Glencore (GLEN.L) , opens new tab about a potential asset combination last year but talks were short-lived amid pushback from Stausholm, according to a source familiar with the matter. Some analysts have speculated a tie-up with Canada's Teck Resources (TECKb.TO) , opens new tab could be a better fit. A new CEO will have to walk a fine line between cost discipline and repositioning the miner for a potentially dramatic shift towards copper, which is expected to be in high demand due to the energy transition. There is an acknowledgement at the company that internal costs, such as staffing, are excessive and it needs a CEO who will better manage them , said the two people briefed by Barton. RBC Capital Markets estimates Rio faces $30 billion to $35 billion in capital spending over the next decade, including $8 billion to $9 billion on lithium projects after Stausholm won rights to two new projects in Chile in May. \"Jakob has previously said they're going to go hard on lithium, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of the lithium growth projects got pushed out a bit in favour of copper,\" said RBC analyst Kaan Peker. Peker said he sees any immediate M&A as unlikely because a new CEO will have to improve the company's share price performance so it can get the most bang for its buck should it use shares to take a tilt at another major miner. CONSTRAINTS One of the sources familiar with the CEO search process said the talk inside the company is of an internal hire. But all of the top contenders have constraints for a board concerned with operational excellence and cost-cutting in particular, analysts and investors said. It was also uncertain if an internal hire will sufficiently address persistent cultural issues such as around safety in Guinea and sexual harassment in Australia, they added. Trott oversaw the final ramp-up of the Gudai-Darri mine that led to its second-highest iron ore shipments ever in 2023 and brought on new replacement projects. He also managed sensitive Aboriginal heritage issues after Rio damaged rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in 2020. But since Trott took on the role in 2021, Rio has continued to be the highest-cost major Australian iron ore producer, its ore quality has dropped and it is guiding for production in the lower half of its expected range for this year due to cyclones \"It's been a tough four years. The business definitely showed turnaround in 2023 but it's been a tough hand with Juukan Gorge and the weather,\" said Barrenjoey analyst Glyn Lawcock. For Baatar, who previously spent three years at the head of Rio's copper business including the Oyu Tolgoi mine in his native Mongolia, the issue is the miner's relationship with the government. Stausholm announced a reset with Mongolia in 2022 including a debt waiver of $2.4 billion, but Rio said last month it had to change its mine plan after the government delayed the transfer of a mining licence. Pecresse is favoured by some board members, according to one of the sources familiar with the search process, after having led a 61% increase in underlying EBITDA for the aluminium division in 2024. He joined Rio in October 2023 and previously led GE's (GEV.N) , opens new tab renewable energy division, significantly expanding its global presence, though the unit struggled with profitability before his departure. Davies is accountable for driving productivity improvements that could aid cost-cutting efforts and has led its smaller marine and titanium and iron arms, but not a major operational division like the other candidates. There is a slim chance that Rio will tap an outsider, analysts said. Newmont (NEM.N) , opens new tab CEO Tom Palmer and former Oz Minerals CEO Andrew Cole have been mentioned as potential external contenders, Reuters reported previously. Investors said Sandfire Resources (SFR.AX) , opens new tab CEO Brendan Harris is also seen as a possible candidate. Harris did not respond to a request for comment.

Eleven suspects have been arrested, the provincial chief minister, Sarfraz Bugti, said in a statement on Monday, hours after he announced that the location and people in the video had been identified. A case has been registered against all those involved, Bugti said, adding that they will be prosecuted. The video shows people in a desert, and some pickup trucks and SUVs in which they had apparently been driven there. The woman is given a copy of the Koran, the Muslim holy book, and she then tells a man: \"Come walk seven steps with me, after that you can shoot me.\" The man then follows her for a few steps. A local police official said the woman did not cry or seek mercy. \"You are allowed only to shoot me. Nothing more than that,\" the woman says in the regional Brahavi language, translated by the official. It was not clear what she meant by \"nothing more than that\". The man, who had followed her, then aimed a pistol at her as she turned her back to the shooter. The woman, wrapped in a shawl, stood still as shots were fired.

REUTERS/Edgar Su KARACHI/SINGAPORE, July 9 (Reuters) - Pakistan’s central bank is preparing to launch a pilot for a digital currency and is finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets, Governor Jameel Ahmad said on Wednesday, as the country ramped up efforts to modernise its financial system. Central banks globally are exploring the use of digital currencies as interest in blockchain-based payments grows. Pakistan’s move follows similar steps by regulators in China, India, Nigeria and several Gulf states to test or issue digital currencies through controlled pilot programmes. Sign up here. At the Reuters NEXT Asia summit in Singapore, Ahmad said Pakistan was “building up our capacity on the central bank digital currency” and hoped to roll out a pilot soon. He was speaking on a panel alongside Sri Lanka’s central bank governor, P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, with both discussing monetary policy challenges in South Asia. Ahmad said a new law would “lay down the foundations for the licensing and regulation” of the virtual assets sector and that the central bank was in touch with some tech partners. The move builds on efforts by the government-backed Pakistan Crypto Council, set up in March to drive virtual asset adoption. The PCC is exploring bitcoin mining using surplus energy, has appointed Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as a strategic adviser and plans to establish a state-run bitcoin reserve. It has also held talks with U.S.-based crypto firms, including the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. In May, the State Bank of Pakistan clarified that virtual assets were not illegal. However, it advised financial institutions not to engage with them until a formal licensing framework was in place. \"There are risks associated, and at the same time, there are opportunities in this new emerging field. So we have to evaluate and manage the risk very carefully, and at the same time not allow to let go the opportunity,\" he said on the panel. On Wednesday, Pakistan's state minister on blockchain and crypto, Bilal bin Saqib, said in a statement that Pakistan's government had approved the \"Virtual Assets Act, 2025\" creating an independent regulator to license and oversee the crypto sector. TIGHT GRIP, FALLING RATES Ahmad said the central bank would continue to maintain a tight policy stance to stabilise inflation within its 5–7% medium-term target. Pakistan has cut its benchmark rate from a peak of 22% to 11% over the past year, as inflation slumped from 38% in May 2023 to 3.2% in June, averaging 4.5% in the 2025 fiscal year just ended, a nine-year low. “We are now seeing the results of this tight monetary policy transfer, both on our inflation as well as on the external account,” he said. Ahmad said Pakistan was not overly exposed to dollar weakness, noting its foreign debt was mostly dollar-denominated and only 13% comprised Eurobonds or commercial loans. “We don’t see any major impact,” he said, adding that reserves had risen to $14.5 billion from under $3 billion two years ago. Ahmad said Pakistan’s three-year $7 billion IMF programme, which runs through September 2027, was on track and had resulted in reforms in fiscal policy, energy pricing and the foreign exchange market. “We are confident that after that (IMF programme), maybe we will not require an immediate (follow-up).” Asked whether Pakistan had financing plans lined up for upcoming military equipment purchases, particularly imports from China, Pakistan’s central bank governor said he was not aware of such plans.

REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LAHORE, July 23 (Reuters) - A Pakistani anti-terrorism court sentenced eight senior members of former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s party to 10 years in prison late on Tuesday over riots that targeted military sites following Khan’s 2023 arrest, their lawyer said. Khan is on trial on similar charges, being tried separately. The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the residence of a senior commander in Lahore. Sign up here. The prosecution is still presenting witnesses in Khan's proceedings, and Tuesday’s verdict does not directly affect his case. The sentences, issued in a jail trial in Lahore, are among a series of prosecutions involving Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. Defence lawyer Burhan Moazzam said they would appeal. “It is surprising that six people were acquitted while eight were convicted, even though they were all charged under the same allegations,” he said. The case relates to one of several incidents stemming from the May 9 unrest, involving alleged incitement during attacks near a major intersection in Lahore. Moazzam said separate trials were ongoing in connection with other incidents that day. Those sentenced include senior PTI figures who held positions in Khan’s Punjab government: Yasmin Rashid, a former provincial health minister; Ejaz Chaudhry, a senator; Mehmoodur Rashid, a former housing minister; and Umar Sarfraz Cheema, a former provincial governor and aide to Khan. The court also acquitted PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi who is in custody in connection with other cases, and it was not immediately clear whether the acquittal would lead to his release. Commenting on the verdict, junior law minister Aqeel Malik told local media the decision was “in line with the law and the constitution.” Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in 2022, remains in prison facing multiple cases, including charges of corruption, contempt, and disclosure of official secrets. He denies wrongdoing and says the cases are politically motivated. The military denies targeting PTI. Authorities say the May 9 violence caused billions in damage and led to over 3,000 arrests in Punjab.

Since Karol Nawrocki's victory over Tusk's liberal ally Rafal Trzaskowski in June's presidential election, dissension within the ruling pro-European coalition has grown, raising doubt about its future under a veto-wielding head of state. Sign up here. Under the reshuffle, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski was promoted to deputy prime minister while keeping his current post. \"We as a government need a very strong political figure in international relations,\" Tusk told reporters. To consolidate oversight of economic affairs, Tusk announced a new superministry combining finance and the economy to be headed by current Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski. \"The most important structural undertaking is building a viable financial and economic centre. There will be a single centre operating transparently and implementing a comprehensive economic policy,\" Tusk said. Milosz Motyka from junior coalition party PSL will head a newly created energy ministry. A judge, Waldemar Zurek, was named to run the justice ministry as it seeks to shore up rule of law standards that critics say deteriorated under the previous nationalist government. Tusk's coalition has steadily declined in opinion polls since mid-2024. This month, the share of government opponents has risen to 48% while the government's support has held steady at 32%, the latest CBOS poll showed. Polls have traced the government's drop in popularity to public disenchantment with a lack of concrete achievements, with the opposition landing effective blows over a failure to stem undocumented migration into Poland. The reshuffle drew criticism from the main opposition Law and Justice party, which lost power in the 2023 election. \"Reconstruction means nothing other than the further destruction of Poland. Some incompetents were replaced by others,\" the party's vice president, Mariusz Blaszczak, said in a post on X. Nawrocki, who will be sworn in as president on August 6, has questioned the coalition's pro-European, liberal agenda but said he is willing to accept moves to increase the tax-free pay threshold and deregulate parts of the economy. \"All laws that will be good for Poles will meet with my approval,\" Nawrocki said in the televised interview on Monday. Tusk, in his remarks announcing the reshuffle, called on supporters not to despair after Nawrocki's presidential victory. \"No defeat, including the presidential election, justifies this mood or despair, this slackness, these thoughts of surrender ... The time of post-election trauma definitely ends today,\" the former European Council president said.

The Philippines and China have had a series of run-ins and heated exchanges in the busy waterway of the South China Sea over the past two years, including an incident in June last year when a Philippine sailor lost a finger. Sign up here. \"The aggressiveness of China has been several years in the making,\" Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro said in an interview at the Reuters NEXT Asia summit in Singapore. \"China's design for the region does not depend on any American leader,\" Teodoro said, replying to a query whether U.S. President Donald Trump's style and stance had served as a catalyst for China's actions. \"It depends on its own plan of action in the region, its own expansionist activities, its own need to control the area.\" While acknowledging that U.S. policies influence regional dynamics, Teodoro said China's actions were \"pre-determined\" by its leadership, regardless of who was in power in Washington. Despite rising tension in the major regional flashpoint of the South China Sea, Teodoro dismissed fears that conflict was on the horizon. \"The prospect of war is not imminent,\" he added. \"I believe it is remote, but that would entirely depend upon the internal conditions of China.\" China's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan.

REUTERS/Edgar Su Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Teodoro said Manila was focused on deterrence, backed by diplomacy. \"You can't have diplomacy without a credible deterrent force, and what we are doing is merely putting a stop, as best as we can, to the illegal incursions of China, which I do not think any country in the world supports,\" he said. To boost its external defence capabilities, the Philippines is investing billions of dollars to modernise its military, and part of that plan is to acquire multi-role fighter jets. While submarines were on the wishlist, Teodoro said they were not a priority at the moment, with the focus on weaponising and building infrastructure to maintain current platforms. Teodoro rejected the notion that ASEAN had failed to respond to China's actions, given that the 10-nation Southeast Asian bloc has been working on a code of conduct with Beijing to avert confrontations in the South China Sea. \"It is obvious that ASEAN countries are wary and worried about China's activities. If not, there would be no call for a code of conduct in the South China Sea. \"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to be very concerned about what is happening.\" Since Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr took office in 2022, Manila has grown increasingly vocal in its opposition to China's actions in the South China Sea, while significantly strengthening ties with traditional ally the United States, and like-minded partners, such as Australia and Japan. Teodoro believed it would be difficult for any future leader to reverse current policy because it has strong public backing. Marcos' single-six year term ends in 2028. \"I feel that any leader in the future, in the face of what China is doing, and in the face of public opinion... and there is a distrust, not of China, but of the Chinese government in what they are doing. So it would be hard for any leader to reshape that narrative,\" he said.

The 1-month non-deliverable forward indicated that the rupee will open flat-to-slightly weaker versus the U.S. dollar from 85.94 on Wednesday. Sign up here. The The dollar index whipsawed Thursday, dropping on speculation that President Trump would sack Fed Chair Jerome Powell, before trimming losses after the report was denied. Trump kept up his pressure on the central bank to cut rates. Trump has been vocal in his frustration with Powell for not cutting rates, which he thinks should be much lower. Trump confirmed that he had floated the idea with Republican lawmakers to fire the Fed chief. Investors were rattled last week by signals that the White House was paving the way to dismiss Powell — a move that would likely spark a sharp market backlash. ING Bank said in a note that the firing of Powell remains a low-probability event. However, Wednesday's market action showed how investors are likely to react if it does materialize - short-term U.S. yields would fall, the dollar would weaken, equities would decline, credit spreads would widen, and long-dated Treasury yields would rise, ING added.

The risk of the rupee coming under further pressure will be among the considerations for the Reserve Bank of India at its upcoming policy review next week, economists at BofA Global Research said in a note. They expect the central bank to keep rates unchanged and \"observe transmission of existing cuts and measures, before choosing the future course of action.\" On the day, the dollar index fleetingly rose to the 99 handle as the euro fell to a one-month low, with investors sobering up to the fact that terms of the trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union favoured the former.

The rupee and the Indonesian rupiah are among the worst performing regional currencies this year, down over 1% each. Globally, investors' focus is on the Federal Reserve's policy decision, due on Wednesday.

The report obtained by Reuters details training which the experts say Rwanda has provided to M23 recruits and military equipment they say Rwanda has deployed - notably \"high-tech systems capable of neutralizing air assets\" - to give the rebels \"a decisive tactical advantage\" over Congo's beleaguered army. Sign up here. The report was submitted to the U.N. Security Council sanctions committee for Congo in early May and is due to be published shortly, said diplomats. M23 has advanced in eastern Congo, seizing the region's two largest cities, Goma and Bukavu, in January and February. Congo, the United Nations and Western powers say Rwanda is supporting M23 by sending troops and arms. Rwanda has long denied helping M23 and says its forces are acting in self-defence against Congo's army and ethnic Hutu militiamen linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). The report by the U.N. experts said Rwanda's military support for M23 was not \"primarily\" aimed at addressing threats posed by the FDLR, asserting that Kigali was instead focused on \"conquering additional territories\". Yolande Makolo, Rwanda government spokesperson, told Reuters on Wednesday the report \"misrepresents Rwanda's longstanding security concerns related to the persistent threat of the FDLR and its affiliated groups, which necessitates the defence posture in our border areas.\" U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is trying to broker a peace deal between Rwanda and Congo that would bring billions of dollars of Western investment to a region rich in tantalum, gold, cobalt, copper, lithium and other minerals. On Friday the Rwandan and Congolese foreign ministers signed a peace deal in Washington and met with Trump, who warned of \"very severe penalties, financial and otherwise\" if the deal is violated. Qatar is hosting a parallel mediation effort with delegations from the Congolese government and M23. Makolo said Rwanda was committed to implementing the deal signed in Washington, including neutralising the FDLR \"which will enable the lifting of Rwanda's defensive measures.\" The U.N. report said Rwanda has hosted leaders of a rebel coalition that includes M23 at its Gabiro Training Centre and also used military centres in Nasho and Gako to train M23 recruits. Rwanda also \"drastically increased\" the number of Rwandan troops in eastern Congo ahead of M23's advance, according to the experts, who offered \"a conservative estimate of 6,000\" Rwandan troops active in Congo's North and South Kivu provinces. The U.N. experts also accused Rwanda of \"flagrant and systematic violations\" of an arms embargo, and said a likely missile attack in January on an armoured personnel carrier carrying U.N. peacekeepers - killing one and injuring four others - appeared to have been fired from a Rwandan military position. An estimated 1,000 to 1,500 Rwandan troops were still active in M23-held territory when the report was drafted, and \"several thousand\" remained along the border ready to deploy, said the report, which covers investigations conducted up to April 20. PUSH FOR PEACE M23's military gains earlier this year spurred fears of a wider regional war drawing in Congo's neighbours, and also fuelled anxiety over the fate of President Felix Tshisekedi's government. In March M23 travelled as far west as Walikale, an area rich in minerals including tin, putting the rebels within 400 km of Kisangani, Congo's fourth-biggest city. The following month, however, M23 withdrew from Walikale, a decision the experts said was \"taken following direct instruction from the Government of Rwanda, once again confirming Rwanda's command and control\" over rebel operations. \"This included strategic-level decision-making on whether to seize, hold, or relinquish territory, thereby demonstrating overall operational coordination and hierarchical subordination,\" the report said. The experts also accused Congo of relying on the FDLR and pro-government militia fighters known as Wazalendo, offering them money and logistics in violation of a sanctions regime. A Congo government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Samsung's mobile president and chief operating officer, Choi Won-joon, said his most important mission was to make Samsung a leader in AI-powered smartphones. \"I believe that foldable phones, integrated with AI features, are ready to become mainstream by offering a unique, differentiated experience,\" he told Reuters in his first media interview since being promoted in March.

Analysts said Samsung's new models tackled some of the issues with foldable phones such as bulkiness, and would create a premium halo around the brand. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 weighs 10% less than its predecessor and is 26% thinner. But high prices and a lack of use cases mean foldable phones are likely to remain a niche segment, the analysts said, with data from research firm IDC showing they account for just 1.5% of the total smartphone market. Research firm Canalys predicts Samsung's foldable shipments, which peaked in 2022, will remain flat or slightly decline in 2025, in line with the broader market's flat growth, according to data provided to Reuters. Samsung's foldable smartphones account for 4% of its total phone sales but 16% of those priced over $800, Canalys said. Its data shows Samsung's dominance of the foldable phone segment is being eroded by Honor and Huawei, which are enjoying strong sales, especially in China. Samsung, which held its unveiling event in New York on Wednesday, will focus on the United States, Europe and South Korea for foldable phone sales, Choi said. At a press conference later on Wednesday following the launch event, TM Roh, president and acting head of Samsung's device experience division, said Samsung is working towards launching a tri-foldable phone, which users can fold three ways, by the end of the year. Samsung's foldable smartphone shipments between 2020 and 2025 In the meantime, Choi said Samsung accelerated output and shipments of smartphones bound for the U.S. to mitigate the impact of looming U.S. tariffs, without giving details. Samsung produces its smartphones in Vietnam , which accounts for more than half of its phone output, as well as in South Korea and India. He also said Samsung has been tackling China's export curbs on rare earths and rare earth magnets by diversifying suppliers beyond the dominant supplier and significantly increasing its own internal stockpiles.

On Friday, China's commerce ministry said that following talks with the U.S., the two sides have confirmed a framework under which China will review export applications for controlled items while the U.S. will cancel corresponding restrictive measures. \"The U.S. have escalated to de-escalate. They put restrictions on many more items in order to get the Chinese to back off on rare earths,\" according to a source familiar with discussions inside the U.S. government. \"As the U.S. and China continue to hold to this framework agreement, we're gonna see a lot of these restrictions go away. Going back to a status quo, where we were at in Feb/March,\" said the source who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. EDA RELIEF Siemens said in a statement that it has resumed sales and support for Chinese customers after it was recently notified by the U.S. Department of Commerce that export control restrictions for customers in China were no longer in place. Its shares rose 1.7% after market open on Thursday. Synopsys expects to complete system updates to restore access and support to Chinese customers within three business days, according to a company letter to staff seen by Reuters. The U.S. Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Long-term restrictions on Chinese access to EDA software would have significantly hampered China's chip design industry. Synopsys, Cadence and Siemens command more than 70% of China's EDA market, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported in April. It was not immediately clear if other countermeasures imposed by the U.S. have been lifted. These include the suspension of licenses for GE Aerospace to ship jet engines for the C919 aircraft of Chinese airplane maker COMAC (CMAFC.UL) and for nuclear equipment suppliers to sell to Chinese power plants.

The fund managers selected as part of Singapore's Equity Market Development Programme (EQDP) are Avanda Investment Management, JP Morgan Asset Management and Fullerton Fund Management, which is owned by Singapore's sovereign fund Temasek.

It added that more than 100 global, regional and local asset managers have shown interest in receiving funds for co-investment under the development programme, and that it will review the submissions in batches to speed up the appointment of asset managers and the deployment of capital. In February, MAS and the Financial Sector Development Fund (FSDF) announced that the S$5 billion programme would invest in strategies managed by Singapore-based asset managers that \"have a strong focus on Singapore listed equities and broaden investor participation beyond large-cap stocks\", the central bank said.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it will maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation of its exchange rate-based policy band. The width and the level at which the band is centred were unchanged. Sign up here. Half of the 12 analysts polled by Reuters ahead of the review expected the MAS to keep policy settings unchanged while the other half forecast a policy easing. \"The risk of a sharp step-down in global growth in the near-term has receded along with the general de-escalation in trade tensions as well as more benign financial conditions since April,\" the MAS said in a statement. It added it was in an appropriate position to respond to risks after two previous easings. The U.S. has in recent weeks cut trade deals with partners, including with Europe and Japan Instead of using interest rates, Singapore manages monetary policy by letting the local dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed trading band, known as the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate, or S$NEER. It adjusts policy via three levers: the slope, mid-point and width of the policy band. OCBC economist Selena Ling said the MAS was keeping its ammunition dry and waiting to see the outcome of tariff negotiations given the two-way risks for inflation. \"Tariff impact on Chinese exports to rest of the world may be disinflationary, but geopolitics and supply chain recalibrations may be inflationary, so the net impact still has to be assessed,\" said Ling. Analysts from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and DBS expect MAS to ease monetary policy for a third time this year at its next meeting in October. The MAS eased monetary policy in January and April this year on growth concerns due to U.S. tariffs after holding settings since a tightening in October 2022. The economy, however, is posting better-than-expected results as exporters rushed out goods to beat the imposition of U.S. tariffs. Singapore avoided a technical recession after the economy grew 1.4% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter, according to preliminary government data. Authorities in Singapore have warned that growth is likely to slow in the second half of 2025 as the export and production frontloading tapers off. \"Prospects for the Singapore economy remain subject to significant uncertainty, especially in 2026,\" the MAS said on Wednesday. In a separate report, MAS said the effective U.S. tariff rate on Singapore's exports is currently at 7.8%, up from 6.8% in April. In April, the government reduced its GDP forecast to 0.0% to 2.0% from 1.0% to 3.0%. Core inflation in the city-state fell to 0.6% year-on-year in June from a peak of 5.5% in early 2023. Maybank economist Chua Hak Bin expects 2025 GDP to come in above the government's forecast. \"We are forecasting GDP growth at 3.2% and expect the trade ministry to upgrade their forecast in August when final second quarter GDP is released,\" Chua said.

Ramaphosa said it was positive that Trump had said the 30% tariff could be modified depending on the outcome of trade talks, and he urged South African companies to diversify. But Agriculture Minister John Steenhuisen and groups representing farmers and the wine industry said it would take time to lock down new export markets.

The United States is South Africa's second-largest trading partner and key destination for vehicles manufactured in the country, which have long benefitted from duty-free access under the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Sign up here. Auto exports to the U.S. sank 73% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, followed by declines of 80% in April and 85% in May, naamsa said. The industry body said the sharp decline would be difficult to recover in the short term. \"This is not just a trade issue - it's a socio-economic crisis in the making,\" naamsa CEO Mikel Mabasa said. Trump has this month escalated the global trade offensive he launched in April, announcing tariffs on more than a dozen countries including South Africa - which faces a 30% rate from August 1. This is separate from the 25% duty imposed on cars in April, which has since May also applied to automotive parts. Before the July tariff announcement from Trump, South Africa had proposed a trade package including a duty-free quota of 40,000 vehicles per year to be exported from South Africa and duty-free access for automotive components sourced locally for U.S. production. In 2024, South Africa's automotive sector accounted for 64% of all AGOA trade with the U.S., generating 28.6 billion rand ($1.60 billion) in export revenue, naamsa said. Mabasa said the tariffs threaten thousands of jobs and risk economic devastation in communities reliant on the sector, such as East London, a coastal city where the auto industry is central to the economy. \"If we cannot retain export markets like the U.S., we risk turning vibrant industrial hubs into ghost towns,\" Mabasa said, warning of ripple effects across the automotive supply chain, from component manufacturers to logistics providers. Export diversification is critical but cannot happen overnight, Mabasa added, noting that global competitors are already redirecting their exports into markets traditionally served by South Africa. This mounting pressure will force South Africa-based automakers exporting to U.S., including Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) , opens new tab , to absorb rising costs, scale back production, and reconsider future investments, Mabasa said.

The Democratic Alliance party, the ANC's main coalition partner, called for a parliamentary inquiry into the allegations against Mchunu. At least one opposition party has called for his suspension.

Just before Trump won the presidential election in November, the countries struck a new five-year plan on sharing the cost of keeping U.S. troops in South Korea.

The comment pushed up the country's policy-sensitive three-year treasury bond futures as much as 0.14 points to 107.29. In a policy statement following the decision, the BOK said there were \"significant uncertainties concerning developments in trade negotiations with the U.S. and concerning the pace of recovery in domestic demand.\" The central bank reaffirmed its commitment to an easy policy path to fight off risks to economic growth while noting its concerns about high household debt and the need to \"assess the effect of the macro-prudential policies.\" Ahn Yea-ha, a fixed-income analyst at Kiwoom Securities, maintained her forecast for another rate cut next month, saying the BOK \"was less hawkish than expected.\" \"If household debt growth stabilises between July and August, a rate cut will be easily possible in August,\" she said. Economists expect the central bank, which has lowered interest rates by a cumulative 100 basis points since October, to deliver at least one more rate cut of 25 basis points this year to underpin the economic recovery. Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump ramped up the trade war he launched this year, telling partners, from powerhouse exporters such as Japan and South Korea to minor players, that they will face high tariffs from August 1. \"At this point, it is really difficult to say when to lower interest rates and where the terminal policy rate will stand,\" governor Rhee said, citing uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, not just on South Korea, but also on Canada, Mexico, Vietnam and China - major manufacturing bases for South Korean companies. Rhee said the board will determine priorities between growth and financial stability risks after assessing more data. Concerns of financial stability risks have grown in recent months, driven by home prices and household debt rising sharply on lower interest rates, prompting policymakers to introduce stricter mortgage rules. The government last week adopted a second supplementary budget for the year with a cash handout scheme to boost domestic demand, as President Lee Jae Myung, who took office on June 4, prioritises shoring up an economy grappling with trade risks and tepid consumption. \"The hand that (the BOK) holds is clear, but there is uncertainty about when to play the cards,\" said Ahn Jae-kyun, a fixed-income analyst at Shinhan Securities, adding that an August rate cut is a possibility.

Trump informed Seoul and more than a dozen other trading partners of sharply higher tariffs in a wave of letters on Monday, posing the first major test for President Lee Jae Myung since he came into office barely a month ago.

South Korea's Industry Ministry said Seoul would \"step up negotiations during the remaining period to reach a mutually beneficial result.\" \"We also plan to use it as an opportunity to improve domestic systems and regulations to resolve the trade deficit that is a major interest of the United States,\" it said in a statement. South Korea earned a record $55.6 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2024, up 25% from 2023, led by rising car exports, according to Korea Customs Service data. Trump said in the letter to Lee that \"our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from reciprocal,\" inviting South Korea to present a proposal to open \"your heretofore closed trading markets\" and eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers. Washington would impose a 25% tariff on all South Korean products but an exemption would be granted to goods manufactured within the United States, he said. South Korea's effective tariff rates stand at near-zero under a free trade agreement first signed in 2007 then revised in 2018 under Trump's first term, according to economists.

A senior South Korean trade official said last week the U.S. showed a willingness to consider exemptions on sectoral tariffs, as it had when agreeing a deal with Britain, if South Korea proposed a clear offer to reduce trade deficits. South Korea's public had already factored in Trump's style, allowing Lee some latitude to work out a deal as long as it did not put the country in a worse-off situation than Japan, Taiwan or China, political analyst Park Sang-byoung said. \"Play good defence but don't be a pushover, that's what South Koreans want from President Lee.\" Morgan Stanley economist Kathleen Oh said greater clarity on Trump's push for concessions on non-tariff barriers and industrial cooperation should give Seoul a better chance to strike a deal.

REUTERS/Violeta Santos Moura/File Photo Summary Sanchez to tighten government procurement contract rules PM says he sees no reason to resign over party scandal Opposition reiterates call for snap elections MADRID, July 9 (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez unveiled a plan to root out corruption on Wednesday, seeking to maintain parliamentary support for his government after senior members of his governing Socialist Party were accused of taking bribes. A Supreme Court judge last month ordered the pre-trial detention of Santos Cerdan, the former number three in the party, over allegations that he received and distributed kickbacks in exchange for awarding public works contracts. Sign up here. Cerdan denies the allegations, which are part of a wider corruption inquiry that has led to opposition calls for a snap election that threaten to destabilise Sanchez's government. Sanchez, who is Secretary General of the Socialist Party, told parliament at an extraordinary session on the case that he had briefly considered quitting but decided to stay on, arguing that he himself had done no wrong. \"I am a clean politician, I will not throw in the towel,\" he said. Sanchez, who again rejected calls for an early election, announced 15 measures including preventing companies found guilty of bribery from winning government procurement contracts and working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's anti-corruption team to crack down on graft. LACKING 'CHECKS AND BALANCES' Last week, Sanchez removed Cerdan allies from the leadership and announced reforms to the party \"to avoid excessive concentration of power\" and provide whistleblower anonymity. Transparency International Spain welcomed the inclusion of civil society in policing public procurement processes and said it would be \"vigilant\" in ensuring the measures announced turned into \"concrete and sustained actions.\" Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, an international lawyer who founded España Mejor, a civic group pushing for political reform, said none of the measures would root out systemic corruption in Spanish political life as none targeted politicians themselves. \"The problem is not just companies, or the administration, the problem is the level of ethics of Spanish politicians and the fact that Spain lacks the basic checks and balances that operate in most other democratic countries,\" she told Reuters. Alberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the opposition People's Party, urged Sanchez to assume responsibility for his party's actions, report what he knew about the case and call elections. \"It's not only the decent way out, but you have no choice,\" Feijoo said. The minority coalition led by the Socialists relies on a loose alliance of smaller parties to pass legislation, which has so far rejected Feijoo's overtures to back a no-confidence vote.

Francisco Salazar offered to step down as a deputy in the organization's secretariat and asked for the allegations to be investigated, the Socialist party (PSOE) said in a statement. Sign up here. The PSOE said it would begin an investigation immediately, adding that no allegations had been made through its usual channels. Online left-wing news website elDiario.es quoted a PSOE employee who accused Salazar of making obscene comments about her clothes and body, inviting her to dine alone with him and asking her to sleep at his home while working in a role junior to him at Moncloa Palace, the prime minister's official residence and workplace. Reuters was not immediately able to contact Salazar for comment. The scandal involving Salazar came just as Sanchez was set to speak at the PSOE's headquarters in Madrid, where he was due to announce measures to assuage members of his party concerned about the damage to its reputation and its ability to survive. Speaking an hour later than scheduled, Sanchez called for any woman suffering sexual abuse to use the channels provided by the party to report it. \"If we believe that a woman's body is not for sale, then there can be no room for behaviour that contradicts this belief,\" he said, without mentioning Salazar. 'CAPTAIN DOES NOT ABANDON SHIP' On Monday, a Supreme Court judge ordered that former PSOE official Santos Cerdan be held in pre-trial detention after he was accused of orchestrating kickbacks in exchange for awarding public works contracts. Cerdan denies the allegations, which are part of a wider corruption inquiry threatening to destabilise Sanchez's government. The PSOE on Saturday named Rebeca Torro as Cerdan's replacement as secretary of organization and two deputies. Salazar would have been the third deputy secretary. Sanchez announced several measures against graft, including reforms to the party machinery \"to avoid excessive concentration of power\" and providing anonymity for whistleblowers. He remained defiant about his ability to continue governing. \"The captain does not abandon ship when rough seas come, he stays to weather the storm,\" he said. The minority coalition led by the Socialists relies on a loose alliance of nationalist and far-left parties to pass legislation. Until now, those allies have said they do not plan to support the conservative People's Party's call for a no-confidence vote that would precipitate an election. Senior party figures arriving at the PSOE headquarters were met with boos from protesters gathered across the road and were forced to raise their voices when declaring their support for Sanchez as the crowd chanted \"out!, out!\" While some said they were confident that Sanchez's reforms would defuse the scandal, others appeared more sceptical. Castile-La Mancha Governor Emiliano Garcia-Page described the scandal as one of the most serious in the half century since the restoration of democracy in Spain following the death of dictator Francisco Franco. \"The leadership needs to understand that if it doesn't offer an exit, if it doesn't offer solutions, then it's part of the problem,\" he said.

Last week saw investors in UK assets rattled by ambiguities around the health of public finances, as a number of U-turns by the governing Labour Party over welfare reforms sparked speculation around the future of finance minister Rachel Reeves. Traders are now shifting their focus to a set of data this week, with Monday bringing a report that showed British house prices stagnated month-on-month during June as expected, after an increase in tax on property transactions took effect in April. However, \"the post April dip is likely to fizzle out\", said Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor. \"Plus, mortgage lending is improving, thanks to four rate cuts from the Bank of England over the last year and two more priced in this year.\" Later in the week, traders will scrutinize a report on gross domestic product that could offer clarity on the health of the UK economy and determine the outlook on interest rates. Bank of England policymaker Alan Taylor said late on Friday that he thought it would be better to cut interest rates now rather than wait and risk needing to cut them in a hurry. Taylor expects the Bank Rate to fall to \"around 3%\" by the end of next year. Traders largely anticipate the next 25 basis points interest rate cut by the central bank will be in September, according to data compiled by LSEG. Meanwhile, investors globally were awaiting a Wednesday deadline ahead of which economies scrambled to strike trade deals with the U.S. to avoid sharply higher duties on their exports to the United States. Britain was the first to secure an agreement with the U.S. in May and has avoided the additional tariffs on steel and aluminium. Negotiations are ongoing to remove existing 25% duties on industrial metals altogether. The pound has appreciated about 2% since the deal with the U.S. and is trading close to its highest level since late 2021, also benefiting from a broader dollar weakness. Separately, a Deloitte survey showed British business executives now see greater opportunities closer to home, while the attractiveness of the United States as an investment destination dwindled. In other news, Reeves is expected to announce a 28.6 million pound ($39 million) investment by the National Wealth Fund in a carbon capture project that could create jobs in central and northern England, as the government strives to shore up public support.

The pound was little changed against the U.S. dollar and was last at $1.35, while against the euro it firmed 0.17% to 86.14 pence. Sign up here. Sentiment globally was one of caution after U.S. President Donald Trump widened his trade war by saying he would impose a 50% duty on imported copper and unveil levies on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Trump said there would be announcements on Wednesday regarding \"a minimum of 7 countries having to do with trade,\" a day after he told 14 nations that they would face sharply higher tariffs from a new deadline of August 1. The pound has been among the top beneficiaries from a selloff in the U.S. dollar on expectations that a global trade war could also hurt the U.S. economy. The UK was also the first economy that signed a trade deal with the U.S., making it less likely to face fresh tariffs, according to analysts. However, market participants were taken aback after last week's UK welfare bill raised expectations that the government is faced with either increasing borrowing or imposing growth-denting taxes to balance public accounts at its Autumn budget. \"Nearer term, the UK government has got itself into a fiscal mess,\" said Derek Halpenny, head of research, global markets EMEA & international securities at MUFG. \"Without a credible big step measure, a credibility gap will persist and risk further dangerous market disruptions. Sharp Gilt sell-offs, like recently, will be pound negative and potentially very disruptive.\" The pound has gained nearly 9% against the dollar this year and is on track for its biggest annual rise since 2017. However, fiscal worries have limited gains recently and the currency is down more than 1.4% from a 2021 high it hit earlier in the month. Meanwhile, the Bank of England released its half-yearly assessment of threats to financial stability, where it flagged that risks to financial markets remain high against the backdrop of U.S. tariffs. Policymakers also loosened the cap on lending to riskier borrowers after a call by the government for regulators to look for ways to encourage economic growth, without risking the stability of the financial system.

That boosted stocks globally, and other risk-friendly currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, as well as the pound. While the pound is still down against both the euro and dollar in July, some analysts see better days for it ahead, as markets look past the volatility in Britain's bond market at the start of the month caused by fiscal concerns, which weighed on the currency. BofA analysts said in a note the third quarter promised to be better for the British economy. \"We feel the conditions are now in place for a bounce in GBP through the summer months,\" they said. \"We do not understate the fragile state of UK public finances but continue to be struck by how markets are willing to find the UK guilty of fiscal breaches before being (given) the opportunity of proving innocence.\" They also flagged that rate differentials were moving in the pound's favour, and that \"tariff attrition in other countries will eventually materialise.\" Thursday's business activity data, and Friday's retail sales data will give the latest indications of the health of the British economy.

The ESA told Reuters the GHF had not fulfilled certain legal requirements to operate in Switzerland, including having the correct number of board members, a postal address or a Swiss bank account. \"GHF confirmed to the ESA that it had never carried out activities in Switzerland...and that it intends to dissolve the Geneva-registered (branch),\" the ESA said in a statement. Last week, Geneva authorities issued a separate legal notice to the GHF to remedy deficiencies within 30 days or face potential action. More than 500 people have been killed near GHF distribution hubs in Gaza or along access roads guarded by Israeli forces since the GHF started operating, according to Palestinian medical authorities in the territory. Israel's military acknowledged on Monday that Palestinian civilians had been harmed near the distribution centres and said its forces had been issued new instructions following what it called \"lessons learned\". The GHF has defended its operations, saying it has delivered more than 52 million meals to needy Palestinians in five weeks, while other humanitarian groups had \"nearly all of their aid looted\". More than 170 humanitarian groups signed a letter this week calling on countries to press Israel to end its new system and return to letting in aid mainly through U.N.-run channels. Israel cut off all supplies into Gaza from the beginning of March until late May, sharply worsening an acute shortage of food in the territory, where nearly all of the 2.3 million-strong population has been displaced by war since 2023.

China confirmed on Monday it will hold a top-level summit with the EU in Beijing this week marking 50 years of diplomatic ties as both sides seek to navigate trade disputes amid broader global trade uncertainties. Lai, meeting members of the European Parliament's Special Committee on the European Democracy Shield at the presidential office in Taipei, said Taiwan and the EU not only have close economic and trade ties, but also share the values of democracy and freedom. \"But in recent years, both have encountered information interference and infiltration by external forces which have attempted to manipulate the results of democratic elections, create confrontation in society, and shake people's confidence in democracy,\" he said, according to a statement from his office. Taiwan, which rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, has repeatedly accused China of interfering in its democracy, spreading fake news and undermining public trust in the government. China denies the accusations, but says Taiwan's government is seeking foreign support to push its own \"separatist\" agenda. For their part, many European countries say Russia has similarly been seeking to discredit European governments and destabilise the EU. Moscow rejects the allegations. Lai said that democracies work not to fight against anyone, but to safeguard a \"treasured\" way of life, just as Europe strives to promote the spirit of pluralism and human rights. \"Standing at the forefront of the world's defence of democracy, Taiwan is determined to work to safeguard democracy, peace and prosperity around the world, and hopes to share its experience with Europe,\" he added.

Family businesses in India, with their multigenerational legacies, strong domestic brands and loyal customers, have become attractive for global investors in recent years. Sign up here. In March, Temasek bought a 10% stake in Haldiram's at a valuation of around $10 billion, with sources describing it as a \"prized asset\" that will help investors expand its focus on India's consumer sector. \"We've been very active in investing behind family-run businesses, we can invest across the value chain,\" Vishesh Shrivastav, managing director of Temasek's India investment team, said in an interview at its Mumbai office. Temasek has earlier invested in many businesses in India which were once run by business families, such as Manipal Hospitals and Dr Agarwal's Health Care. In a separate factsheet, Temasek said it was \"keen to partner more family-owned businesses to drive long-term value creation.\" It did not name any potential targets. Temasek spent $2 billion in April 2023 to raise its stake in Manipal to 59% from 18% in the biggest hospital sector deal ever in India. It later sold a minority stake to Novo Nordisk's parent Novo Holdings and Abu Dhabi's sovereign investor Mubadala , but retained majority control of the hospital chain. Asked about Manipal Hospitals possible public offering, Shrivastav said it was \"an eminently listable company,\" without elaborating. India continues to be Temasek's best-performing market over the last decade, as it remained the world's fastest-growing major economy and the second largest IPO market in 2025. Temasek said it maintained its positive outlook for India and its 2023 goal of investing up to $10 billion in Asia's third-largest economy over a three-year horizon.

    "full_text": "Summary Thousands of Afghans relocated to UK after leak Minister apologises for 'serious data incident' Government faces lawsuits from those affected LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - Britain set up a secret scheme to bring thousands of Afghans to the UK after their personal details were disclosed in one of the country's worst ever data breaches, putting them at risk of reprisals from the Taliban after their return to power. Concerns that individuals could be targeted by the Taliban led the previous Conservative government to set up the relocation scheme, involving thousands of people and estimated to cost the government about 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion). Sign up here. The leak by the Ministry of Defence in early 2022, which led to data being published on Facebook the following year, and the secret relocation programme, were subject to a so-called superinjunction preventing the media reporting what happened, which was lifted on Tuesday by a court. British defence minister John Healey apologised for the leak, which included details about members of parliament and senior military officers who supported applications to help Afghan soldiers who worked with the British military and their families relocate to the UK. \"This serious data incident should never have happened,\" Healey told lawmakers in the House of Commons. \"It may have occurred three years ago under the previous government, but to all whose data was compromised I offer a sincere apology.\" The incident ranks among the worst security breaches in modern British history because of the cost and risk posed to the lives of thousands of Afghans, some of whom fought alongside British forces until their chaotic withdrawal in 2021. Healey said about 4,500 Afghans and their family members have been relocated or were on their way to Britain under the previously secret scheme. But he added that no-one else from Afghanistan would be offered asylum because of the data leak, citing a government review which found little evidence of intent from the Taliban to seek retribution against former officials. The review, a summary of which was also published on Tuesday, said more than 16,000 people affected by it had been relocated to the UK as of May this year, though some of those had been relocated to the UK under existing schemes.

SUPERINJUNCTION LIFTED The government is facing lawsuits from those affected by the breach, further adding to the ultimate cost of the incident. Sean Humber, a lawyer at Leigh Day who has acted for Afghan citizens affected by previous data breaches, said those affected were \"likely to have strong claims for substantial compensation\" for the anxiety and distress caused by the leak. British forces were first deployed to Afghanistan in 2001 following the September 11 attacks on the United States, and they played a major role in combat operations there until 2014. In early 2022, a spreadsheet containing details of Afghans who had worked for the British government prior to the Taliban takeover in 2021 and had applied for relocation to Britain was emailed to someone outside of government systems by mistake. The superinjunction was first granted in 2023 after the Ministry of Defence, under the former Conservative government, argued that a public disclosure of the breach could put people at risk of extra-judicial killing or serious violence by the Taliban. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's centre-left government, which was elected last July, launched a review into the injunction, the breach and the relocation scheme.

An internal diplomatic cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio showed the United States, which has already barred entry for citizens from 12 countries, was considering expanding travel restrictions to the 36 countries, including three Pacific Island states, Reuters and other media reported last month. Sign up here. Nations on the list would have 60 days to take corrective action, the cable showed. The news had caused significant concern in Tuvalu, whose population of 11,000 is at risk from rising sea levels , and where a third of residents have applied to an Australian ballot for a landmark climate migration visa. Tuvalu's ambassador to the United Nations, Tapugao Falefou, said he had been told by a U.S. official that Tuvalu's inclusion on the list was \"an administrative and systemic error on the part of the U.S. Department of State\". In a statement on Tuesday, Tuvalu's government said it had not received any formal notification that it was on the list, and had also been assured by the United States embassy in Fiji it was \"an error within the system\". \"The Embassy has provided verbal assurances that there are no current restrictions on Tuvaluan nationals entering the United States, and that the matter is being reviewed with authorities in Washington,\" the statement from Tuvalu's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Labour and Trade said. It added Tuvalu was seeking a \"formal written confirmation to that effect and continues to engage the U.S. Government to ensure Tuvaluans are not unfairly affected\". The U.S. embassy in Fiji, citing U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order suspending entry for 12 countries, said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday that the United States was protecting national security through the its visa process. \"The Department of State and other U.S. government agencies assess other countries' security capabilities; information-sharing and identity management practices; exploitation of the U.S. visa system, such as overstay rates; and failure to facilitate the repatriation of their removable nationals,\" a spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Suva said. The Secretary of State would consult with the Attorney General, Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence to assess whether suspensions should be \"continued, terminated, modified or supplemented\", the statement added. A U.S. official familiar with visa policy who is not authorized to speak publicly told Reuters \"no decisions have been made, and any speculation is premature\". \"Tuvalu's public statement mischaracterizes and omits some of the valid concerns the United States has with travelers from that country,\" the official added. The other Pacific Islands listed in the cable were Vanuatu and Tonga. Tonga's government had received an official U.S. warning, and was working on a response, Tonga media reported.

The three automakers corner over 60% of India's car market, the third-largest in the world, where sales growth has lately stuttered after hitting record-highs for three successive years. Maruti's sales for June dropped to their lowest since December 2023. The 'Swift' hatchback manufacturer took a hit in small cars – its largest segment – that have become costlier due to stricter safety and emission rules. \"The once mass small-car segment is not participating in the growth at all,\" said Rahul Bharti, Maruti's senior executive officer of corporate affairs. Sales of the company's utility vehicles, mostly sport utility vehicles (SUVs), dropped 8.5% in June, to their lowest level since December 2023. Meanwhile, Tata Motors' dispatches slid 15% to their lowest level since December 2021, while Hyundai logged a 12% decline in domestic sales. Hyundai's Chief Operating Officer Tarun Garg said in a release that the company is \"cautiously optimistic about a gradual recovery of demand.\" Tata, too, said it is counting on its newly launched vehicles to support the carmaker in a year where \"overall industry growth is expected to remain subdued.\" Indeed, industry insiders have said they expect overall car sales to grow about 1%-2% in the year to March 2026, compared to last year's 2% growth. Mahindra, an exception to the trend, said its SUV sales grew 18% in June to end the quarter with record-high dispatches to dealers. The blistering growth has powered Mahindra to the no. 2 spot in India's car market, a position held by Hyundai for the large part of two decades.

Sign up here. \"The Commerce Department made the right call in banning the H20,\" Moolenaar said in the letter, demanding more information. \"We can't let the (Chinese Communist Party) use American chips to train AI models that will power its military, censor its people, and undercut American innovation.\" Nvidia's (NVDA.O) , opens new tab announcement this week that it would be allowed to resume sales reversed an export restriction imposed by the Trump administration in April to keep advanced AI chips such as the H20 out of Chinese hands over national security concerns, an issue that has found rare bipartisan support. It drew swift questions and criticism from U.S. legislators, including Moolenaar, who said on Monday that he would seek \"clarification\" from the Commerce Department. Shares of Nvidia turned negative on Friday after Moolenaar came out with the stronger criticism. An Nvidia spokesperson later defended the U.S.' relaxation of restrictions, saying America wins when the world builds on U.S. technology. \"The government made the best decision for America, promoting U.S. technology leadership, economic growth and national security,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. A representative of the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The letter was an unusual example of public disagreement with a Trump administration policy from a fellow Republican, signaling the depth of the national security concerns around the AI chip's export to China among China hawks in Washington. On Tuesday, Lutnick said the planned resumption of sales of the H20 chip was part of U.S. negotiations on rare earths and magnets. It also was a sign the United States was relaxing restrictions on the export of AI technology to China. Nvidia designed the H20 chip for the Chinese market after the Biden administration restricted exports of other of its advanced chips to China. But the H20 is still competitive at inference, where AI models serve up answers to users, which is fast becoming the biggest part of the AI chip market. Its capabilities also could be used in supercomputers. According to an April 2025 report by the Select Committee on China, Nvidia's H20 chips were instrumental in enabling an AI model by Chinese company DeepSeek that surprised the world earlier this year. Tech companies like China's Tencent also have used H20s to train massive AI systems, according to Moolenaar, who said there was growing evidence H20 chips are being used by Chinese AI companies to build supercomputers. Under the policy change, the U.S. still must approve licenses for the export of H20 chips. But Nvidia said it had been assured licenses would be granted, and it hoped to start deliveries soon. In his letter to Lutnick, Moolenaar requested a briefing as soon as possible, but no later than August 8, on how the Department of Commerce plans to evaluate license applications for the H20 and similar chips, the estimated number of H20s to be exported and to whom. \"The H20 significantly outperforms anything Chinese chipmakers like Huawei can currently produce\" at scale, Moolenaar wrote, \"and would therefore provide a substantial increase to China’s AI development.\" Reporting by Chris Sanders and Karen Freifeld; Additional reporting by Alexandra Alper.

When asked by a reporter on Sunday whether he still planned to phase out FEMA following the Texas floods, Trump responded that it was a topic \"we can talk about later\". \"The president’s FEMA Review Council, comprised of top experts in their field, will recommend to the president how FEMA may be reformed in ways that best serve the national interest, including how America responds to and recovers from disasters such that the federal role remains supplemental and appropriate to the scale of disaster,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email to Reuters.

The Texas floods, the first major deadly disaster since Trump took office in January, were a stark reminder of the extent to which states lean on the agency during a crisis.

    "full_text": "Katie Miller, wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino attend a press conference with U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 30, 2025. REUTERS/Nathan Howard/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) - In recent days, Republican circles in Washington have buzzed with speculation that former Trump administration official Katie Miller, an aide to Elon Musk and wife of one of the president's closest advisers, and Musk have had a falling out. Their social media activity fueled rumors that she was distancing herself from Musk since his explosive break-up with U.S. President Donald Trump. Sign up here. But in an interview with Reuters, Miller denied that was the case. She said she still works for Musk, though she declined to describe her role or whether she serves as a spokesperson for him or his companies. \"My paycheck still comes from him,\" she said. Late on Wednesday, after she spoke with Reuters, Miller issued a Musk-related press statement, apparently for the first time in around two weeks based on media reports of the statements and a statement received by Reuters. The statement, on behalf of xAI, Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, denounced an environmental group’s actions against the company in Tennessee. Miller is married to influential Trump official Stephen Miller, the chief architect of the administration's controversial immigration policies and other initiatives. Both worked in Trump's first administration, which ran from 2017 to 2021. Katie Miller was appointed by Trump as an adviser to the bureaucracy-slashing Department of Government Efficiency led by Musk, whose companies include SpaceX and Tesla, until around the time he left that role at the end of May. Musk's feud with Trump, over the administration's spending plans, swiftly followed. She left the government to work for Musk over a month ago and appeared to work for Musk’s companies as a communications adviser. Her exact role was never made public. Miller recently revamped her X profile, which once featured a banner photo of a SpaceX rocket, to highlight her life as a mother and wife. She posted photos of her workouts and beach excursions with her children. In a move that often signals a personal or professional break, Musk in recent days unfollowed her account on X, his social media platform. Weeks before, he had unfollowed Stephen Miller, though he has re-followed him. With Musk recently parting ways with several top executives at his companies and the apparent split on X, three Republican sources told Reuters they suspected that Katie Miller had also split with Musk. Katie Miller did not respond to questions about why she had changed her X profile and why Musk had unfollowed her. Musk and X did not respond to requests for comment. Musk has been close to the Millers and spent time at their Washington-area home while working on DOGE, according to people familiar with the matter. But Katie Miller’s continued alliance with Musk raised eyebrows among Republican operatives. People who have worked with her describe her as a Trump loyalist and said they were surprised that she had continued to work for the billionaire as he attempted to torpedo Trump policies that her husband worked closely on, like the Big Beautiful Bill.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Trump says Powell should deliver lower rates Economists say political influence over monetary policy never ends well Goldman Sachs notes rising risk to Fed independence, inflation expectations increase WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is a \"numbskull\" who has kept interest rates too high, but he will be out in eight months, President Donald Trump said at a news conference on Tuesday. \"I think he's done a bad job, but he's going to be out pretty soon anyway. In eight months, he'll be out,\" he said from a meeting at the White House with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Sign up here. Powell's term as Fed chair runs through May 15, and he has repeatedly said he will not leave the post early. Eight months would mean Powell would remain in place until mid-March; it was not immediately clear why Trump picked that time frame. Trump has been hammering at Powell for months for not cutting rates and has frequently raised the possibility of ousting him, while also saying that firing him would be \"unlikely.\" Lately, the White House has intensified Trump's pressure campaign, launching a review of the Fed's renovation of two buildings in Washington which they say are inappropriately lavish and may not have followed planning protocols, charges that the Fed vigorously rejects. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday repeated his call for a \"big internal investigation\" of the Fed's non-monetary policy operations. Economists warn that efforts to push the Fed to loosen monetary policy could actually have the opposite effect. They point to hyperinflation in countries from Argentina to Zimbabwe as examples of what can happen when politicians exert influence on central bank rate-setting. Some see evidence in financial markets that the Trump administration's constant attacks on Powell are eroding confidence in the Fed's ability to achieve its dual goals of price stability and maximum employment. \"Market participants seem to agree that the risk to Fed independence is rising,\" Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius wrote late on Monday, pointing to a rise in longer-term inflation expectations as captured in 5-year 5-year forward inflation swaps, which measure expected inflation over five years beginning five years out. \"A further increase could make Fed officials more reluctant to cut,\" Hatzius said. If inflation expectations rise, the thinking goes, actual inflation is likely to follow. Powell and other Fed officials believe that longer-term inflation expectations remain stable, but they say they are watching nearer-term measures closely, particularly with tariffs likely to increase upward price pressures as companies pass on more of the costs to consumers. \"Efforts by the administration to push the (Fed) into an accommodative monetary policy stance that would not be justified by macroeconomic conditions would likely backfire with higher long-term rates, higher inflation expectations, and ultimately the need for a tighter monetary policy stance,\" Barclays economists wrote on Tuesday. On Tuesday Trump repeated his view that the policy rate should be 3 percentage points lower than it is now. The central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee is nearly universally expected to leave the policy rate in its current range of 4.25%-4.50% when it meets next week, as policymakers wait to see how inflation and employment react to tariffs. \"Our economy is so strong now, blowing through everything. We're setting records,\" Trump said on Tuesday. \"But you know what? People aren't able to buy a house because this guy is a numbskull. He keeps the rates too high, and is probably doing it for political reasons.\" Bessent, at the same meeting, raised a different complaint against the Fed. \"The Fed has had big mission creep, and that's where a lot of the spending is going,\" Bessent said. \"That's where, why they're building these new, or refurbishing these buildings, and I think they have got to stay in their lane.\" Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt, Andrea Shalal, Michael S.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is also being pitched as a potential candidate, according to the newspaper, which also listed former World Bank President David Malpass and Fed governor Christopher Waller as potential nominees. According to the Journal, Trump has toyed with the idea of selecting and announcing a replacement as early as September or October. However, Bessent told Bloomberg TV on Monday that the Trump administration is considering using the next expected Federal Reserve Board of Governors vacancy in early 2026 for appointing a successor. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has criticized Powell and other Fed governors for deciding not to lower interest rates, which are currently in the 4.25%-4.50% range. Fed chairs have long been seen as insulated from presidential dismissal for reasons other than malfeasance or misconduct, but Trump has threatened to test that legal premise with frequent threats to fire Powell.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo Summary Trump says Republicans are not sticking together Some supporters want more details on sex offender's case WASHINGTON, July 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday attacked fellow Republicans critical of his administration's handling of the case of dead sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. On social media and in the Oval Office, Trump lashed out at allies he said were falling for a \"hoax\" pushed by Democrats, who \"unlike Republicans ... stick together like glue.\" Sign up here. Epstein, a wealthy financier and convicted sex offender, was facing federal charges of sex-trafficking minors when he died by suicide in jail in 2019. He had pleaded not guilty, and the case was dismissed after his death. Some of Trump's most loyal followers were enraged when the Trump administration last week reversed course on its pledge to release documents it had suggested contained major revelations about Epstein and his alleged clientele. \"It's all been a big hoax,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans, and foolish Republicans fall into the net and so they try and do the Democrats' work.\" On Truth Social earlier in the day, Trump said of Republicans raising concerns about the case: \"Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore!\" The backlash over the Epstein case has laid bare tensions inside Trump's coalition and is testing one of Trump's most enduring political strengths: his ability to command loyalty and control the narrative across the right. A former Trump adviser, Mike Flynn, on Wednesday said on X that the matter was not a hoax. \"With my strongest recommendation, please gather your team and figure out a way to move past this,\" he said. The Justice Department last week concluded there was \"no incriminating client list\" or any evidence that Epstein may have blackmailed prominent people. The review also confirmed prior findings by the FBI that Epstein killed himself in his jail cell while awaiting trial, and that his death was not the result of a criminal act such as murder. The findings contradicted earlier suggestions — made before Trump's inauguration in January by current Trump administration officials Dan Bongino and Kash Patel — that the government was concealing key information about the Epstein case. A February comment by Attorney General Pam Bondi, which she later clarified, further amplified the speculation. In recent weeks, the rumors have gained traction as conservative influencers and media figures have continued to promote the idea of hidden bombshell disclosures. Some House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, have called for the Justice Department to release more Epstein documents. But Republicans have blocked efforts by Democratic lawmakers to push measures that would force the agency to make those documents public. Trump, who knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s, on Wednesday again defended Bondi's handling of the matter and said she could release any credible documents related to the case. \"Whatever's credible, she can release,\" he told reporters. \"If a document's there that's credible, she can release. I think it's good.\" But he was also eager to move past the issue. \"I'd rather talk about the success we have with the economy,\" he said.

Sign up here. In a letter, Trump linked the tariffs to Brazil's treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial over charges of plotting a coup to stop Lula from taking office in 2023. The levies were imposed due \"in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans,\" the letter said. Lula, his vice-president, his finance minister, and others held an emergency meeting in Brasilia on Wednesday night to discuss the new levies. In a lengthy post to social media after the meeting, Lula said Trump's accusations that trade between the two countries was unfair to the U.S. were false, stressing the U.S. runs a trade surplus against Brazil. \"Sovereignty, respect, and the unwavering defense of the interests of the Brazilian people are the values that guide our relationship with the world,” Lula wrote. The U.S. is Brazil's second-largest trading partner after China and the tariffs are a major increase from the 10% announced in April. Trump's letter said the 50% tariff will start August 1 and will be separate from all sectoral tariffs. On Monday, Lula pushed back against Trump after the U.S. leader threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on the BRICS group of developing nations, which he called \"anti-American.\" \"The world has changed. We don't want an emperor ,\" Lula told reporters when asked at a BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro about the possible BRICS tariff. BOLSONARO 'WITCH HUNT' Tensions between the United States and Brazil had already intensified on Wednesday after Brazil's foreign ministry summoned the U.S. Embassy chargé d'affaires over a statement defending Bolsonaro. Containers sit at the Port of Los Angeles, in San Pedro, California, U.S., July 8, 2025. REUTERS/Daniel Cole/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Around the same time, Trump , speaking to reporters at an event with West African leaders at the White House, said Brazil \"has not been good to us, not good at all,\" adding the tariff rates would be based on \"very, very substantial facts\" and past history. The U.S. Embassy in Brasilia confirmed on Wednesday its chargé d'affaires had a meeting with officials from Brazil’s foreign ministry, though it declined to share details about the conversation. Trump's support for Bolsonaro echoed his support for other global leaders who have faced domestic legal cases like French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump has called cases against those leaders a \"witch hunt,\" a term he used for cases he faced himself in the U.S. after the end of his first term in office. Trump said in a social media post on Monday that Bolsonaro was the victim of such a \"witch hunt.\" The U.S. Embassy in Brasilia issued a statement on Wednesday to the local press echoing his remarks. \"The political persecution of Jair Bolsonaro, his family and his supporters is shameful and disrespectful of Brazil's democratic traditions,\" it said. In a post on social media, Bolsonaro did not mention Trump, but said he \"is persecuted because he remains alive in the public consciousness. Even out of power, he remains the most remembered—and most feared—name.\" In his letter, Trump also directed U.S. Trade Representative James Greer to initiate a probe into what he called unfair trade practices by Brazil, particularly on U.S. companies' digital trade. Trump also criticized decisions from Brazil’s Supreme Court that he said censored social media firms. Brazil's Supreme Court has long been criticized by Bolsonaro's allies for ordering social media websites to take down content from leaders of their far-right movement. The court also imposed more responsibilities on those companies last month. In his post on Wednesday, Lula rebuffed Trump’s accusations of a witch hunt and said the case against Bolsonaro was up for the courts to decide and not subject to any “threats that could compromise the independence of national institutions.” Lula also defended his country’s Supreme Court and its ruling on social media and said “freedom of expression must not be confused with aggression or violent practice.” IMPACT ON FOOD EXPORTS The tariffs on Brazil could have a significant impact on food prices in the United States. Around a third of the coffee consumed in the U.S., the world's largest drinker of the beverage, comes from Brazil, which is the world's largest coffee grower. Annual Brazilian coffee exports to the U.S. are close to 8 million bags, according to industry groups. More than half of the orange juice sold in the U.S. comes from Brazil, which has an 80% share of the juice's global trade. The South American agricultural powerhouse also sells sugar, beef and ethanol to the U.S., among other products. \"This measure impacts not only Brazil, but the whole U.S. juice industry that employs thousands of people and has had Brazil as its main supplier for decades,\" said Ibiapaba Netto, the executive director of Brazilian orange juice industry group CitrusBR.

The lawsuit filed in Miami federal court names Murdoch, Dow Jones, News Corp (NWSA.O) , opens new tab and its Chief Executive Robert Thomson, and two Wall Street Journal reporters as defendants, saying they defamed Trump and caused him to suffer \"overwhelming\" financial and reputational harm. Sign up here. Epstein, the disgraced financier and sex offender, died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019. His case has generated conspiracy theories that became popular among Trump's base of supporters who believed the government was covering up Epstein's ties to the rich and powerful. Trump has said he parted ways with Epstein before the financier's legal troubles became public in 2006. The president has vehemently denied the Journal report, which Reuters has not verified, and had warned Murdoch that he planned to sue. Dow Jones, the parent of the newspaper, is a division of News Corp. \"We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS 'article' in the useless 'rag' that is, The Wall Street Journal,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"I hope Rupert and his 'friends' are looking forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide in this case,\" Trump added. A spokesperson for Dow Jones said in a statement: \"We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\" The lawsuit called Trump's alleged birthday greeting \"fake,\" and said the Journal published its article to harm Trump's reputation. “Tellingly, the Article does not explain whether Defendants have obtained a copy of the letter, have seen it, have had it described to them, or any other circumstances that would otherwise lend credibility to the Article,” the lawsuit said. To prevail on his defamation claims, Trump must show the defendants acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning they knew the article was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth. A $10 billion award would far exceed the largest defamation judgments and settlements in recent history. These include a $1.5 billion judgment against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and Fox News' settlement with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million. \"Ten billion dollars is a ridiculously high number,\" said Jesse Gessin, a lawyer with experience in defamation and First Amendment litigation. \"It would be the largest defamation verdict in U.S. history.\" WHITE HOUSE ROILED The Epstein affair has increasingly disquieted the White House, after the Justice Department this month concluded that there was no evidence to support long-held conspiracy theories about his clients and death. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a dinner with Republican Senators, in the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 18, 2025. REUTERS/Annabelle Gordon Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Some of Trump's most loyal followers became furious after his administration reversed course on its promise to release files on Epstein. A Justice Department memo released on July 7 concluded that Epstein killed himself and said there was \"no incriminating client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent people. With pressure to release the Epstein files building, Trump on Thursday said he directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to ask a court to release grand jury testimony about Epstein. The U.S. government on Friday filed a motion in Manhattan federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts in the cases of Epstein and former associate Ghislaine Maxwell. She was convicted in 2021 of five federal charges related to her role in Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls. Maxwell is appealing her conviction and 20-year prison sentence to the U.S. Supreme Court. \"Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested and concerned about the Epstein matter,\" Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in the filing. \"After all, Jeffrey Epstein is the most infamous pedophile in American history.\" Blanche said prosecutors would work to redact all victim-identifying information before making anything public. The release of the grand jury documents may fall short of what many of Trump's supporters have sought, including case files held by the administration, and a judge may reject the administration's request to make the transcripts public. BAWDY LETTER The Journal said the letter bearing Trump's name was part of a leather-bound birthday book for Epstein that included messages from other high-profile people. It also said the letter contained several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appeared to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. The newspaper said the letter concluded \"Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret,\" and featured the signature \"Donald.\" Allegations that Epstein sexually abused girls became public in 2006, after the birthday book was allegedly produced, and he was arrested that year before accepting a plea deal. Epstein died just over a month after he was arrested for a second time and charged with sex-trafficking conspiracy. Trump was photographed with Epstein multiple times in social situations in the 1990s and early 2000s, and had been a neighbor of Epstein's in Florida. He was quoted in 2002 in New York magazine as saying, \"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\" In 2019, Trump told reporters that he and Epstein had a \"falling out\" before the financier was first arrested. Trump said he \"knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him\" but that \"I had a falling out with him. I haven't spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you.\" Reporting by Nandita Bose, Trevor Hunnicutt and Jasper Ward in Washington; Jonathan Stempel and Dietrich Knauth in New York; Jarrett Renshaw in Philadelphia; Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, and Ismail Shakil in Ottawa; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Matthew Lewis, Rosalba O'Brien and Diane Craft Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab"

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Bolsonaro's inner circle stunned by move meant to help Ex-president's aides had hoped for targeted sanctions US tariffs could end up bolstering support for Lula SAO PAULO, July 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pitched his 50% tariffs against Brazil as a way to support former President Jair Bolsonaro, but three people close to the right-wing ex-president said they were stunned by the move and fear it may do more harm than good. Announcing the higher tariffs in a letter last week, Trump cast them as a pressure tactic to help Bolsonaro, who is on trial before the Brazilian Supreme Court for allegedly plotting a coup to overturn his loss in the 2022 presidential election. Sign up here. Bolsonaro has described the accusations as baseless and insisted he will run for president in 2026, despite a court decision that bars him from the race. In his tariff letter, Trump said his ally Bolsonaro is the victim of a \"witch hunt.\" Brazil's leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who defeated Bolsonaro in 2022, has neither the interest nor the ability to interfere in the case. Last week, he dismissed Trump as an unwanted \"emperor\" and threatened retaliation if trade negotiations do not advance. Bolsonaro allies fear the steep tariffs, likely to hurt Brazilian sectors from coffee and orange growers to cattle ranching and the aviation industry , could rally national pride behind a defiant Lula, supporting his sagging popularity Backlash against Trump has already given a boost to several of his ideological foes abroad. Left-of-center parties surged to victory in Canadian and Australian elections this year, riding a wave of opposition to Trump's policies, while hard-right Trump allies have struggled in Romania and Hungary Bolsonaro's inner circle had been eager for a display of Trump's support since he returned to the White House. Lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, one of the former president's sons, took a leave of absence from Brasilia and moved with his family to rally support for his father in Washington. But the thrill of catching Trump's attention soon curdled as the Bolsonaros realized the crushing weight of the tariffs tied to their cause, according to the sources, who said the family had expected targeted sanctions against one judge overseeing the Supreme Court case. Now the Bolsonaro clan has no alternative but to support Trump and his letter, even while understanding that the move \"could provoke negative reactions,\" said one of the sources, requesting anonymity to discuss private conversations. SCATHING EDITORIALS Last week, in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement, leaders of Brazil's Congress who had been fighting Lula on several fronts issued statements supporting him. \"The banner of nationalism holds a very significant appeal, especially within the right-wing camp,\" said Graziella Testa, a professor of political science at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Brasília. A close association with Trump may prove electorally toxic for allies of Bolsonaro, whose political future was already clouded by the threat of a possible prison sentence and the court decision barring him from public office until 2030. \"It is absolutely deplorable that there are still people in Brazil who defend Trump,\" wrote the conservative opinion page of major Brazilian newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo in an editorial last week. \"Wearing Trump's cap today means aligning oneself with a troglodyte who could cause immense damage to the Brazilian economy.\" Bolsonaro representatives declined to comment on the newspaper's editorial. On Sunday, the former president tried to show empathy for his supporters without alienating Trump. \"It doesn't make me happy to see our rural and urban producers, as well as the people, suffer with this 50% tariff,\" he said on social media, adding: \"The solution is in the hands of the Brazilian authorities.\" Other conservative politicians in Brazil are also trying to strike a tricky balance in their public comments. Sao Paulo Governor Tarcisio de Freitas, who launched his political career from Bolsonaro's cabinet and is now seen as a possible heir to his electorate, initially blamed Lula's ideology for the tariff hike on social media. By Friday, he was shifting focus to Washington, saying on X that he had met with the head of the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia to \"open a dialogue ... based on data and consolidated arguments.\" The lawmaker Bolsonaro criticized his former ally's efforts to negotiate a compromise and pinned the blame for the situation squarely on Lula's administration, which the hard-right has sought to characterize as a leftist dictatorship. \"I'm sorry, but there is no way to ask President Trump — or any remotely decent international authority — to treat a dictatorship as if it were a democracy,\" he wrote on X.

But this year, the harvest is filled with uncertainty after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 30% tariff on European products that has sent shivers through industries from wine to olive oil and autos. Sign up here. Peach farmers and factory owners are worried that the tariffs will dent demand for their produce just as they are preparing to send their fresh harvest overseas, giving them little time to adapt or find alternative markets. Greece is the world's biggest exporter of tinned peaches, about one fifth of which goes to the United States, its second biggest market after Europe. Peaches, like some other goods, are already subject to a U.S. import levy of 17%. The new tariffs could increase the total import duty to 47%. \"Now is even worse because it finds us at the peak, where the entire plant and all the production lines are working at full speed,\" said Lazaros Ioannidis, co-owner of a peach and fruit processing plant near Naoussa that sends about 40% of its produce to big U.S. companies like Dole.

Exports to the United States represent about 4% of Greece's total exports. Canned peach and peach derivatives, olives and olive oil are the three top exported agriculture products to the U.S., bringing home about half a billion euros annually. More than 20,000 families, farmers and workers make their income from peach farms and peach factories in Central Macedonia, according to Kostas Apostolou, head of the Greek Canners Association. \"Our size might be small as a percentage for the country or the EU but for the region its a big source of income, vital for it's survival.\" \"For the past 6 months, since Trump took office, we have been in a period of an absolute turmoil,\" says Apostolou. He said that the only alternative is to diversify exports to Mercosur countries in South America or to Mexico and India and urged the EU to sign a trade agreement with those countries. The EU was planning to approve a trade deal with Mercosur but has faced opposition from some countries. Still, there are also optimists \"Trump is unpredictable. We hope that he will prove that and he will change this decision,\" said farmer Vangelis Karaindros as he and his employees picked ripe peaches by hand.

REUTERS/Cagla Gurdogan/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab ANKARA, July 17 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank is expected to kick off a renewed easing cycle with a 250 basis-point rate cut to 43.50% next week, as disinflation continues and market turmoil has largely faded, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday. All but one of the 17 economists in the July poll forecast the central bank would cut its one-week repo rate at the July 24 meeting. The median forecast was for a 250 basis-point cut to 43.50%, with predictions ranging from 42.50% to 44.50% among those expecting an easing step. Sign up here. Thirteen respondents expected a cut of 250 basis points, while one predicted the bank to hold rates at 46%. Most expect rate cuts to continue in the months ahead, with the policy rate falling to 36% by the end of 2025, according to the median of 17 forecasts in the Reuters poll. The monetary easing will likely to continue through at least the third quarter of 2026, an earlier Reuters poll of economists showed. If delivered, the move would mark the first cut since a surprise 350 basis-point hike in April, which reversed an earlier easing cycle. That tightening helped stabilize markets after the jailing of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu triggered a sharp selloff in Turkish assets and the lira in March. Morgan Stanley expects a 250 basis-point cut this month, followed by three additional cuts of the same size to bring the policy rate to 36% by year-end. \"While we expect a rise in the monthly inflation trend in July due to administered price adjustments, we expect this to be temporary given weaker domestic demand (negative output gap) and our expectation for the bank to deliver prudent rate cuts to keep the monetary stance tight,\" the bank said. Annual inflation slowed to 35.05% in June, slightly below expectations. Monthly inflation was 1.37%, with price declines in key categories such as food and beverages reinforcing the central bank's view that a disinflation trend is taking hold. Political risks remain on investors' radar. The lira and Turkish bonds weakened last week after the detention of opposition mayors in Adana, Adiyaman and Antalya in a widening corruption probe. While prosecutors described the arrests as anti-graft measures, many see them as politically motivated moves against the opposition party CHP. The central bank will announce its interest rate decision at 1100 GMT on July 24.

The Office for Budget Responsibility said in an annual assessment of its forecasting that its projections had overestimated annual economic growth by an average of 0.7 percentage points when looking five years ahead. Sign up here. The OBR said its over-optimism about the five-year outlook since the office was created in 2010 was mirrored in projections by a range of other forecasters. But the report is likely to add to expectations that the official forecasts that underpin the government's tax and spending plans will be cut later this year, further complicating the task facing Reeves to stick to her budget rules. Allan Monks, an economist with JP Morgan, said the last time the OBR made a large downgrade to its growth forecasts in 2017 it said that the change had been foreshadowed in its forecast evaluation report. \"The key question now is magnitude,\" Monks said. If the OBR shaves 0.1-0.2 percentage points from its forecast for average annual potential economic growth, it could cost the public finances between 9 and 18 billion pounds a year, he said. The OBR said in March that Reeves had only a small buffer of just under 10 billion pounds ($13.7 billion) for meeting her fiscal rules as she aims to balance day to day public spending with tax revenues by the end of the decade. Economists have said she may have to announce further tax increases to stay on track to hit those targets after recent decisions by the government to water down its plans for savings in welfare spending.

These included people it said were involved in targeting strikes against Mariupol during the war in Ukraine, and spying on former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia before they were targeted in a Novichok poisoning in Britain in 2018. \"GRU spies are running a campaign to destabilise Europe, undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and threaten the safety of British citizens,\" foreign minister David Lammy said in a statement. British authorities have repeatedly accused Moscow of orchestrating malign activity , ranging from traditional espionage and actions to undermine democracy, to sabotage and assassinations. Moscow has rejected such accusations, saying they are politically motivated and that it poses no threat to Britain. The Russian embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this month, three men were convicted over an arson attack on a Ukrainian-linked business in London which police said was carried out at the behest of Russia's Wagner mercenary group. The European Union and NATO issued statements on Friday condemning what they described as Russia's destabilising hybrid activities. 'SOPHISTICATED MALWARE' In its latest announcement, Britain said three Russian GRU units - 29155, 26165 and 74455 - had targeted media outlets, telecoms providers, political and democratic institutions, and energy infrastructure in the United Kingdom and across Europe. Among these incidents were an Estonian government hack in 2020, a cyberattack on the German Bundestag in 2015, the hacking in 2016 of the U.S. Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and cyberattacks on the Paris Olympics last year, Britain said. The NCSC said a hacking group known as APT 28, part of GRU unit 26165, had developed \"sophisticated malware\" it dubbed \"AUTHENTIC ANTICS\" which tricks users of Microsoft cloud accounts into entering their credentials into a login window controlled by the hackers. The NCSC did not say who had been targeted by the malware. Representatives for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The British foreign ministry also said Unit 26165 had conducted reconnaissance on the Mariupol Theatre in March 2022 ahead of air strikes that local officials said killed about 300 people. Russia denied deliberately targeting the theatre. In addition to the GRU-focused sanctions, the ministry said it was sanctioning three leaders of \"African Initiative\", which it said was a Russian-funded social media content mill conducting information operations in West Africa. Britain has recently ramped up its military spending to help change its approach to defence, partly to address threats from Russia, nuclear risks and cyberattacks.

In May, both countries announced the conclusion of trade negotiations after three years of stop-start negotiations, aiming to increase bilateral trade, remove trade barriers and allow duty-free entry of goods.

The countries are now preparing to formally sign the agreement, and the announcement could coincide with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's expected visit to London next week, one of the Indian officials said. The trade pact will take effect in about a year, after it is approved by the British parliament and India's federal cabinet, the official added. Officials spoke on the condition of anonymity as the details are not public. \"The trade agreement offers a win-win for both countries,\" the second Indian source said, adding that Indian consumers would gain access to Scotch whisky at lower prices, as import tariffs will drop to 75% from 150% immediately, and further to 40% over the next decade. On cars, India will cut duties to 10% from 100% under a quota system that will be gradually liberalised, the sources said. In return, Indian manufacturers are expected to gain access to the UK market for electric and hybrid vehicles, also under a quota regime, they added. India's commerce ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Britain's trade ministry said that the countries were working to finalise the deal. \"We have been working with India on a landmark trade deal that will deliver for British people and business,\" a UK government spokesperson said. India's trade ministry has said 99% of Indian exports to Britain would benefit from zero duty under the deal , including textiles, while Britain will see reductions on 90% of its tariff lines.

Teenager Axel Rudakubana, who was obsessed with violence and genocide, launched the knife attack at the summer vacation event in northern England last July, killing the girls and wounding another 10. Sign up here. The incident shocked the nation and was followed by days of nationwide rioting Just 17 at the time of the attack, Rudakubana was jailed in January for at least 52 years after he admitted the offences just as his trial was about to start. Prosecutors said his motive was not clear and it appeared to be simply the desire to commit mass murder. After the conviction, Prime Minister Keir Starmer ordered the inquiry into state failings as it emerged in the trial that Rudakubana had been referred to a counter-radicalisation scheme three times, but no action had been taken. Rudakubana had been involved in previous troubling incidents where he had been arrested carrying a knife, whilst he had purchased other weapons including machetes as well as ingredients to make Molotov cocktails. He also had an Al-Qaeda training manual and had produced the lethal poison ricin. \"As the government at the highest levels has recognised, the perpetrator is responsible for one of the most egregious crimes in our country’s history,\" said the inquiry chair, Adrian Fulford, who added that the killer's name would not be used out of sensitivity for the victims' families. The inquiry will begin by looking at the teenager's history and repeated prior involvement with public bodies, such as the police, social services and mental health services, before a second phase examines the wider issue of children being drawn into violence, an increasing concern for British authorities. \"We need to understand what went wrong and thereafter to identify and implement the most effective measures to ensure, to the extent that we are able, that there is no repetition,\" Fulford said. Lawyers for the three murdered girls - Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine - said they hoped it would uncover the truth. \"We know that nothing the inquiry reveals, or subsequently recommends will change the unimaginable loss felt by the families of Elsie, Alice and Bebe, but we all now have a responsibility to ensure that something like this never happens again,\" they said in a statement.

    "full_text": "LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - A British man offered personal information about former defence minister Grant Shapps to Russian intelligence for money, prosecutors said on Wednesday at the start of his trial for a National Security Act offence. Howard Phillips is accused of offering Shapps' home address and phone number to two people he believed were Russian agents, but were in fact British undercover officers. Sign up here. The 65-year-old denies one count of engaging in conduct intended to materially assist a foreign intelligence service, a crime that carries a potential sentence of up to 14 years in jail. His trial began at Winchester Crown Court on Wednesday, when prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward said Phillips offered to help Russian intelligence \"not necessarily for ideological reasons or because he sympathised with the Russian state\". Ledward said Phillips had sought to carry out \"easy – and, perhaps, interesting or exciting – work for easy money\". Phillips in October 2023 applied for a job with the United Kingdom's Border Force and was approached in March 2024 by purported Russian agents, using the names Sasha and Dima, Ledward said. She added that Phillips maintained his job application despite his apparent contact with Russian agents in the belief the job \"might give him access to information that he could later provide\". Ledward said Phillips was asked to save a file onto a clean USB stick, stating what he could offer and why, and hide it inside a parked bicycle on a London street in April 2024. The document stated that Phillips could \"facilitate the collection of an operative from any port of entry, provide them with safe harbor, travel, assistance and return them to a designated place of embarkation undetected\". Phillips met Sasha and Dima in a London hotel later that month, and then met Dima in May 2024, saying he knew Shapps' home address, telephone number and where his private plane was kept as he had visited Shapps' house, Ledward said. Phillips, whose trial is due to take up to three weeks, is also accused of offering logistical support, booking a hotel and buying a mobile phone for a foreign intelligence service.

The government moved to ban Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws last month after its activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and damaged two planes in protest against what the group said was Britain's support for Israel. Sign up here. Late on Friday, the campaign lost an urgent appeal against the parliamentary vote to proscribe it as a terrorist organisation, with the ban coming into force from midnight. Under UK laws, offences include inviting support, expressing approval, or displaying symbols of a banned group and are punishable by up to 14 years in prison and/or a fine. Britain has proscribed 81 groups under anti-terrorism laws, including Hamas, al-Qaeda and ISIS. On Saturday, supporters gathered in Parliament Square in Westminster, some holding placards that said \"I OPPOSE GENOCIDE. I SUPPORT PALESTINE ACTION.\" Sky News footage showed some being led away in handcuffs from a statue of Indian independence hero Mahatma Gandhi in the square, as they shouted their support. United Nations experts have accused Israel of carrying out \"genocidal acts\" against Palestinians in the conflict in Gaza , which began after Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Israel has repeatedly dismissed such accusations. PRIDE PARADE PROTEST Palestine Action has targeted Israel-linked companies in Britain in its protests, with interior minister Yvette Cooper saying that violence and criminal damage have no place in legitimate protest and that the group's activities justify proscription. Critics of the decision, including some United Nations experts and civil liberties groups, have argued that damaging property does not amount to terrorism.

REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo Summary Letby, convicted of murdering seven babies, maintains innocence Probe continues into other possible crimes by Letby, hospital management's role LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - British police said on Tuesday they had arrested three senior hospital managers on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter as part of investigations into nurse Lucy Letby, who was convicted two years ago of killing babies in a neonatal unit. Letby, 35, is serving life in jail after being found guilty of murdering seven newborns and attempting to murder eight more between June 2015 and June 2016 while working at the Countess of Chester Hospital (CoCH) in northern England. Sign up here. Letby, Britain's worst serial child killer of modern times, has maintained her innocence throughout but has been refused permission to appeal against her convictions. She has been told she would never be released. Following her jailing, police began to investigate possible corporate manslaughter offences at the hospital, an inquiry that was later widened to consider if individuals might be guilty of gross negligence manslaughter. Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes, who is leading the investigation, said three unnamed members of the hospital's senior leadership team had been arrested on Monday. They were subsequently released on bail, pending further inquires. \"Both the corporate manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter elements of the investigation are continuing and there are no set time scales for these,\" Hughes said in a statement, adding that this did not impact Letby's convictions. CHALLENGE TO EVIDENCE Hughes said that a police investigation was continuing into whether Letby had committed more crimes at the hospital and at another unit where she had previously worked. Since she was jailed, some lawmakers, medical experts and other specialists have publicly challenged the prosecution evidence that was used to find her guilty. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which examines potential miscarriages of justice, is considering an application from Letby's legal team, and last month, former health minister Jeremy Hunt said the case should be urgently re-examined. Letby's lawyer Mark McDonald said in a statement that the police announcement came at a sensitive time. \"Despite this, the concerns many have raised will not go away, and we will continue to publicly discuss them,\" McDonald said. Kate Blackwell, a lawyer for the hospital's senior managers, told a public inquiry examining how the murders were able to take place that there were other explanations for the deaths which needed to be considered. The managers strongly denied accusations they \"deliberately and knowingly\" protected a murderer, Blackwell said. Police have previously said scepticism about the case was based on partial knowledge of the facts presented to the courts. The findings of the public inquiry are due to be published early next year after the chairman rejected calls for her work to be paused.

REUTERS/Hatem Khaled/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - Britain rejected Israeli criticism on Wednesday that it was rewarding militant group Hamas by setting out plans to recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel took steps to improve the situation in Gaza and bring about peace. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's ultimatum, setting a September deadline , prompted an immediate rebuke from Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, who said it rewarded Hamas and punished the victims of the fighters' 2023 attack that triggered the war. U.S. President Donald Trump also said he did not think Hamas \"should be rewarded\" with recognition of Palestinian independence. Sign up here. But British Transport Minister Heidi Alexander - designated by the government to respond to media questions on Wednesday - said: \"This is not a reward for Hamas. \"Hamas is a vile terrorist organisation that has committed appalling atrocities. This is about the Palestinian people. It's about those children that we see in Gaza who are starving to death,\" Alexander said. \"We've got to ratchet up pressure on the Israeli government to lift the restrictions to get aid back into Gaza.\" Starmer's decision follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron, who announced last week that Paris would recognise Palestinian statehood in September, becoming the first major Western power to do so, because of the dire humanitarian conditions in the enclave. Previously, Britain and France, like other Western powers, had been committed to Palestinian independence, but as a goal that would best be achieved only at the conclusion of negotiations with Israel. In a televised address on Tuesday, Starmer said it had become necessary to act because the prospect of such a two-state solution was now under threat. Britain would make the move at the U.N. General Assembly in September unless Israel took substantive steps to allow more aid into Gaza, made clear it would not annex the West Bank and committed itself to a long-term peace process that delivered a two-state solution, Starmer said. The most immediate impact of Britain recognising a Palestinian state may be an upgrading of diplomatic relations, according to one British government official. UPGRADING RELATIONS Britain now hosts a Palestinian mission in London which could be upgraded to an embassy, and Britain could eventually open an embassy in the West Bank, the official said. Starmer's move \"will isolate Israel more and more, but it won't change anything on the ground,\" said Azriel Bermant, a senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague. Bronwen Maddox, chief executive of the Chatham House think-tank, said the move put Britain into the forefront of countries trying to negotiate a solution, but that Starmer may have \"muddled things by using recognition as a threat to Israel, when it is a goal of British foreign policy\". \"He might have done better to use other threats, for example sanctions or arms controls against Israel for the immediate crisis in Gaza, to get Israel to change its behaviour there,\" she said. The Board of Deputies of British Jews, Britain's biggest Jewish advocacy group, raised concerns that similarly clear conditions had not been set out for Hamas, which is still holding 50 hostages it seized in its October 2023 attack. Alexander, when asked whether recognition was conditional on the release of hostages, said that the government would review whether to go ahead with recognition in September and Britain had long said Hamas must release hostages. The Muslim Council of Britain, the country's largest Muslim umbrella organisation, said that making recognition conditional contradicted the government's stated position that statehood was the inalienable right of the Palestinian people.

Overall shop prices in July rose by 0.7% in annual terms - the largest rise since April 2024 - after a 0.4% rise in the 12 months to June, the British Retail Consortium said on Tuesday. Food prices jumped by 4.0%, speeding up from a 3.7% rise in June, up by the most since February 2024.

Prices of staples such as meat and tea were pushed up sharply due to tighter supplies on global markets although discounts in fashion and furniture offered some relief to consumers, the organisation said. Last week separate data from Worldpanel showed a 5.2% annual rise in grocery prices in the four weeks to July 13, the biggest increase since February 2024. Britain's headline rate of inflation - which covers a broader range of goods and services - sped up to 3.6% in June from May's 3.4%, threatening to rise above the BoE's forecast for it to peak at around 3.7% in September. The central bank expects inflation to fall back to its 2% target only in 2027. It is expected to cut borrowing costs on August 7 for the fifth time since August last year but stick to its \"gradual and careful\" message about further reductions in interest rates. The Confederation of British Industry said on Monday its gauge of retail sales fell for a 10th month in a row in July - although less sharply than in June - with consumers feeling the strain of rising prices. The BRC data was based on prices collected between July 1 and July 7. Writing by William Schomberg; editing by David Milliken Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab"

    "full_text": "LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - Sixteen- and 17-year-olds celebrated their newly granted right to vote in all UK elections on Thursday, but cautioned that proper education was vital to boost turnout and protect young voters from political misinformation on social media. \"I'm really happy about it because I've always been kind of frustrated just watching politics and not being able to do anything,\" said 16-year-old student Matthew Caronna, adding that many government policies directly impact young people.

In a major overhaul of the country's democratic system, the government said the proposed changes were part of an effort to boost public trust in democracy and would align voting rights across Britain, where younger voters already participate in devolved elections in Scotland and Wales. \"A lot of people, even from a very young age, have very strong opinions, and they think their opinions should be heard,\" Ana Fonseca, 16, said. \"Even though we are young, it is important to have a say.\" Jess Garland, director of policy and research at the Electoral Reform Society, said lowering the voting age to 16 could have a long-term impact, as starting to vote earlier may increase the likelihood of continued participation in adulthood. There are about 1.6 million 16- and 17-year-olds in the UK. Just over 48 million people were eligible to vote at the last election , in which turnout fell to its lowest since 2001. The next election is due in 2029. A man unlocks his bicycle after voting at a polling station in Rickmansworth, Britain, May 1, 2025.

A poll of 500 16- and 17-year-olds conducted by Merlin Strategy for ITV News showed 33% said they would vote Labour, 20% would vote Reform, 18% would vote Green, 12% Liberal Democrats and 10% Conservative. \"All the right-leaning sources get pushed far more than the left-leaning ones (on social media),\" Matilda Behrendt, a 17-year-old student, warned. \"I think that will be a problem but it also means... various political ideologies can be spread and the ideas can be put across.\" Julian Gallie, head of research at pollsters Merlin Strategy, said political parties will need to further step up their social media efforts to engage voters under 18.

Sign up here. \"Everyone united around the idea of ruining our independence,\" Kryvonos told Reuters in an interview in Kyiv, referring to parliament passing the controversial measures. \"This was a shock for me - how much demand had built up to destroy us.\" He spoke a day after Zelenskiy sought to defuse tensions by submitting legislation restoring the independence of NABU and its sister agency, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO). Thousands of protesters took part in protests in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities this week after lawmakers fast-tracked a bill granting a Zelenskiy-appointed general prosecutor power over the two bodies. The move had also threatened Kyiv's ties with the European Union and Western donors which have been a critical source of financial and military support during Russia's war in Ukraine Kryvonos applauded Zelenskiy's reversal, but said NABU and SAPO remain a high-priority target for vested interests aiming to stymie their closely watched efforts to clean up. Parliament will consider Zelenskiy's new bill in a special session next week. But Kryvonos worries corrupt actors will step up a \"dirty information campaign\" already being waged against NABU on widely read anonymous Telegram channels, casting the agency as slow or ineffective. He did not identify the exact sources of resistance to his agency's work, saying only that they are \"various representatives of the government, various financial groups\". \"Everyone who is offended by NABU and SAPO will be pushing out this message,\" Kryvonos said. 'SYSTEMIC WORK' AND THREATS Since Russia's February 2022 invasion, Ukraine has stepped up a campaign to eradicate the pervasive graft that has plagued its political culture for decades. Stamping out corruption is both critical to Kyiv's bid to join the EU and its effort to erase a legacy of autocracy and Russian rule. NABU and SAPO, launched with Western support after a 2014 revolution toppled a pro-Russian president, have levelled charges against lawmakers and senior government officials. In recent months, Kryvonos's agency has uncovered huge real estate schemes in the capital Kyiv and accused a then deputy prime minister of taking a $345,000 kickback. Kryvonos suggested such efforts had led to a sweeping crackdown this week that paved the way for the rollback of NABU's and SAPO's powers. Two NABU officials were arrested for suspected ties to Russia and nearly 20 other agency employees searched over lesser alleged infractions in a campaign critics said went too far. \"All of this was a result of systemic work by NABU and SAPO, especially over the past half-year,\" he said, adding that he had also received \"a huge amount\" of threats. Despite winning a hard-fought victory this week, he said resistance was still widespread enough across the political landscape to pose a serious challenge. He cited the controversial law that had been supported by most of Zelenskiy's political party as well as opposition lawmakers and those associated with former pro-Russian factions. Political elites, Kryvonos said, \"need to stop considering us as enemies...and accept us as an important part of state institutions.\" Editing by Timothy Heritage Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab"

REUTERS/Yamam al Shaar/File Photo Summary UN report says concerns raised over ideological ties between HTS members and Al Qaeda Diplomats expect US to seek removal of UN sanctions on HTS and Syrian President Sharaa China and Russia worry about foreign fighters in Syrian army UNITED NATIONS, July 10 (Reuters) - United Nations sanctions monitors have seen no \"active ties\" this year between Al Qaeda and the Islamist group leading Syria's interim government, an unpublished U.N. report said, a finding that could strengthen an expected U.S. push for removing U.N. sanctions on Syria. The report, seen by Reuters on Thursday, is likely to be published this month. Sign up here. Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham is Al Qaeda's former branch in Syria but broke ties in 2016. The group, previously known as al-Nusra Front, led the rebellion that toppled President Bashar al-Assad in a lightning offensive in December, and HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa became Syria's interim president. The report comes as diplomats expect the United States to seek the removal of U.N. sanctions on HTS and Sharaa, who has said he wants to build an inclusive Syria with equal rights for all. \"Many tactical-level individuals hold more extreme views than ... Sharaa and Interior Minister Anas Khattab, who are generally regarded as more pragmatic than ideological,\" the U.N. report said. It covered the six months to June 22 and relied on contributions and assessments from U.N. member states. Since May 2014, HTS has been subject to U.N. sanctions including a global assets freeze and arms embargo. A number of HTS members also face sanctions like a travel ban and asset freeze - including Sharaa, who has been listed since July 2013. The U.N. monitors wrote in their report to the Security Council: \"Some member states raised concerns that several HTS and aligned members, especially those in tactical roles or integrated into the new Syrian army, remained ideologically tied to Al Qaeda.\" U.S. President Donald Trump announced a major U.S. policy shift in May when he said he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria. He signed an executive order enacting this at the end of June, and Washington revoked its foreign terrorist organization designation of HTS this week. The U.S. said then that revoking the designation was a step towards Trump's vision of a peaceful and unified Syria. The U.S. is \"reviewing our remaining terrorist designations related to HTS and Syria and their placement on the U.N. sanctions list,\" a State Department spokesperson told Reuters. Diplomats, humanitarian organizations and regional analysts have said lifting sanctions would help rebuild Syria's shattered economy, steer the country away from authoritarianism and reduce the appeal of radical groups. Trump and his advisers have argued that doing so would also serve U.S. interests by opening opportunities for American businesses, countering Iranian and Russian influence and potentially limiting the call for U.S. military involvement in the region. OBSTACLES TO US EFFORT But Washington faces diplomatic obstacles to get Security Council backing for removing the sanctions. The U.S. will also need to win support from Russia - which was an ally to Assad - and China for any Syria sanctions relief at the U.N., diplomats said. Both are particularly concerned about foreigners who joined HTS during the 13-year war between rebel groups and Assad. The U.N. experts said there were estimated to be more than 5,000 foreign fighters in Syria. The status of foreign fighters has been one of the most fraught issues hindering Syria's rapprochement with the West. But the U.S. has given its blessing to a plan by Syria's new leaders to integrate foreign fighters into the army. “China is gravely concerned about such developments. The Syrian interim authorities should earnestly fulfill their counter-terrorism obligations,\" China’s U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong told the Security Council last month. He said Syria must combat terrorist organizations including \"the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, also known as the Turkistan Islamic Party.” Uyghur fighters from China and Central Asia are members of the Turkistan Islamic Party. Rights groups accuse Beijing of widespread abuses of the mainly Muslim ethnic minority. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council last month that it was essential Syria's \"army and police are staffed exclusively by professional personnel with untainted track records,\" an apparent reference to irregular fighters like militants. The U.N. monitors said some foreign fighters rejected the move to integrate them into the military. \"Defections occurred among those who see Sharaa as a sell-out, raising the risk of internal conflict and making Sharaa a potential target,\" the U.N. experts said.

The Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General is opening the review after two serious communications outages for air traffic controllers overseeing Newark’s airspace in April and May sparked alarm and delayed dozens of flights. Sign up here. The New Jersey airport is one of the main airports serving New York City and a hub for United Airlines (UAL.O) , opens new tab . In May, the FAA ordered flight cuts at Newark following a series of major disruptions. \"These events have raised questions about FAA’s management of the relocation, including impacts on system redundancy, controller staffing and training, and operational resilience,\" the inspector general's office said. The FAA required 17 air traffic controllers to move from New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, known as N90, to Philadelphia in late July last year. New York TRACON is one of the busiest U.S. facilities. The FAA said \"persistent low staffing levels and low training success rate\" at N90 were among the reasons to move control of the Newark airspace in a bid to boost staffing levels and help ease congestion. On Monday, the FAA said it welcomed feedback and would cooperate fully with the audit. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who sought the probe, has questioned if the administration of former President Joe Biden took enough precautions to ensure telecommunications reliability when ordering the move. Earlier this month, the FAA began using a new fiber optic communications network between New York and the Philadelphia TRACON that directs aircraft in and out of Newark. Last week, the FAA extended cuts to minimum flight requirements at congested New York City airports through October 2026. The FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels. A series of near-miss incidents has raised safety concerns in recent years, while the persistent staffing shortage has delayed flights and forced controllers at many facilities to work mandatory overtime and six-day weeks.

The men were deported on Friday, the July 4 Independence Day holiday in the U.S., Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a press release. Sign up here. \"This was a win for the rule of law, safety and security of the American people,\" McLaughlin said. An aircraft carrying U.S. deportees arrived in South Sudan on Saturday, two officials working at Juba airport said. An airport staffer speaking on condition of anonymity told Reuters he had seen a document showing that the aircraft \"arrived this morning at 6:00 am\" (0400 GMT). An immigration official also said the deportees had arrived in the country but shared no further details, referring all questions to the National Security Service intelligence agency. Earlier, a South Sudan government source said U.S. officials had been at the airport awaiting the migrants' arrival. The fate of the migrants had become a flashpoint in the fight over the legality of the Trump administration's campaign to deter immigration through high-profile deportations to so-called \"third countries\" where migrants say they face safety concerns, which has already gone from lower courts to the Supreme Court twice. South Sudan has long been dangerous even for local residents. The U.S. State Department advises citizens not to travel there due to violent crime and armed conflict. The United Nations has said the African country's political crisis could reignite a brutal civil war that ended in 2018. The eight men, who according to their lawyers are from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam, had argued their deportations to South Sudan would violate the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. They had been held in U.S. custody in Djibouti since a federal judge in Boston in May blocked the Trump administration from immediately moving them to South Sudan over due process concerns. Following additional litigation, the Supreme Court on Thursday sided with the administration , lifting those limits. Two courts considered requests from the migrants' lawyers on an emergency basis on Friday, when courts are otherwise closed for the holiday, but ultimately U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston said the Supreme Court order required him to deny their bid, clearing the way for their deportation. The location of the men in South Sudan after their arrival was not immediately known.

    "full_text": "Summary Companies Personal consumption expenditures price index rises 0.3% Goods prices post largest gain since January Core PCE inflation increases 0.3%; up 2.8% year-on-year Consumer spending gains 0.3%; saving rate steady at 4.5% Weekly jobless claims increase 1,000 to 218,000 WASHINGTON, July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. inflation increased in June as tariffs boosted prices for imported goods like household furniture and recreation products, supporting views that price pressures would pick up in the second half of the year and delay the Federal Reserve from resuming cutting interest rates until at least October. The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed goods prices last month posting their biggest gain since January, with also solid rises in the costs of clothing and footwear. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday left its benchmark interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments after the decision undercut confidence the central bank would resume policy easing in September as had been widely anticipated by financial markets and some economists. Sign up here. \"The Fed is unlikely to welcome the inflation dynamics currently taking hold,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research, Fitch Ratings. \"Rather than converging toward target, inflation is now clearly diverging from it. This trajectory is likely to complicate current expectations for a rate cut in September or October.\" The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3% last month after an upwardly revised 0.2% gain in May, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PCE price index climbing 0.3% following a previously reported 0.1% rise in May. Prices for furnishings and durable household equipment jumped 1.3%, the biggest gain since March 2022, after increasing 0.6% in May. Recreational goods and vehicles prices shot up 0.9%, the most since February 2024, after being unchanged in May. Prices for clothing and footwear rose 0.4%. Outside the tariff-sensitive goods, prices for gasoline and other energy products rebounded 0.9% after falling for four consecutive months. Services prices rose 0.2% for a fourth straight month, restrained by cheaper airline fares and steady prices for dining out and hotel stays. In the 12 months through June, the PCE price index advanced 2.6% after increasing 2.4% in May. The data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the second quarter published on Wednesday, which showed inflation cooling, though remaining above the Fed's 2% target. Economists said businesses were still selling inventory accumulated before President Donald Trump's sweeping import duties came into effect. They expected a broad increase in goods prices in the second half. Procter & Gamble (PG.N) , opens new tab said this week it would raise prices on some products in the U.S. to offset tariff costs. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for monetary policy. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index increased 0.3% last month after rising 0.2% in May. In addition to higher goods prices, the so-called core PCE inflation was lifted by rising costs for healthcare as well as financial services and insurance. In the 12 months through June, core inflation advanced 2.8% after rising by the same margin in May. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. People shop for groceries at a store in New York City, U.S., July 15, 2025. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab A line chart titled \"Annual change in US Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index\" that compares two key inflation metrics over the past five years. CONSUMER SPENDING STEADY The BEA also reported that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose 0.3% in June after being unchanged in May. The data was also included in the advance GDP report, which showed consumer spending growing at a 1.4% annualized rate last quarter after almost stalling in the first quarter. In the second quarter, economic growth rebounded at a 3.0% rate, boosted by a sharp reduction in the trade deficit because of fewer imports relative to the record surge in the January-March quarter. The economy contracted at a 0.5% pace in the first three months of the year. Spending is being supported by a stable labor market, with other data from the Labor Department showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended July 26. But a reluctance by employers to increase headcount amid uncertainty over where tariff levels will eventually settle is making it harder for those who lose their jobs to find new opportunities, which could hamper future spending. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, was unchanged at a lofty seasonally adjusted 1.946 million during the week ending July 19, the claims report showed. The government's closely watched employment report on Friday is expected to show the unemployment rate rising to 4.2% in July from 4.1% in June, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Economists expect pressure from tariffs and a slowing labor market will put a brake on consumer spending in the third quarter. Slow growth is likely already in the works as inflation-adjusted consumer spending edged up 0.1% in June after declining 0.2% in May. Precautionary saving could also curb spending. The saving rate was unchanged at 4.5% in June. Though a third report from the Labor Department showed wage growth picking up in the second quarter, inflation-adjusted annual gains moderated to 0.9% from 1.1% in the 12 months through March. The BEA report showed inflation cutting into income for households after accounting for taxes, which was flat in June. Signs of financial strain are also emerging among higher-income households, who have largely been driving spending. Lower- and middle-income families have been disproportionately affected by tariff-related price increases, higher borrowing costs and slowing economic activity. \"While consumer spending has thus held up — supported by solid income gains — it now faces mounting headwinds from a cooling labor market and renewed inflationary pressures,\" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon.

In late June, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for President Donald Trump's administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harms they could face.

Earlier this month, a top Trump administration official said in a memo that U.S. immigration officials may deport migrants to countries other than their home nations with as little as six hours' notice. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will generally wait at least 24 hours to deport someone after informing them of their removal to a so-called \"third country,\" according to a memo dated July 9 from the agency's acting director, Todd Lyons. ICE could remove them, however, to a so-called \"third country\" with as little as six hours' notice \"in exigent circumstances,\" the memo said, as long as the person was provided the chance to speak with an attorney. The memo stated that migrants could be sent to nations that have pledged not to persecute or torture them \"without the need for further procedures.\" The new ICE policy suggested the Trump administration could move quickly to send migrants to countries around the world. Human rights advocates have raised due process and other concerns over Trump's immigration policies that his administration has cast as measures aimed at improving domestic security.

Concerns over the Southeast Asian manufacturing hub's outlook had been growing in the run up to the trade deal announced on Wednesday, particularly as the United States is Vietnam's biggest export market. Sign up here. Gross domestic product growth in the April-June quarter accelerated to 7.96% year-on-year, from the 6.93% in the first quarter, government data showed on Saturday. It was just short of Hanoi's full-year growth target of at least 8%. \"Economic performance in the first half of this year was positive and close to our target amid global and regional economic uncertainties,\" the National Statistics Office said. Exports were a bright spot in the last quarter, rising 18.0% to $116.93 billion from a year earlier, while imports were up 18.8% at $112.52 billion, translating into a trade surplus of $4.41 billion, the NSO data showed. Industrial production in the period rose 10.3%, while June consumer prices rose 3.57%. Trump announced on Wednesday the United States and Vietnam reached a trade deal , under which Vietnamese goods would face a 20% tariff, with trans-shipments from third countries through Vietnam also facing a 40% levy. Vietnam could import U.S. products with a zero percent tariff. The tariff rates were lower than an initial 46% rate threatened by Trump in April. Vietnam hailed the deal as a boost for business and said negotiators were working to finalise details, as business groups awaited clarity on the finer points to assess the impact of the new tariffs. The United States is the largest export market for Vietnam, a regional manufacturing hub housing several multinational companies such as Samsung Electronics and Foxconn. The United States recorded a trade deficit of $123 billion with Vietnam last year, one of its highest globally. Vietnam is also home to several Chinese companies, which analysts said are likely the main targets for the 40% tariff on trans-shipments. China is Vietnam's largest two-way trading partner on which it relies heavily for components and materials for its manufacturing industries. Fitch Solutions said in a note on Friday that Vietnam's exports and investment will remain strong for the rest of the year and signalled upside risks for its 2025 GDP growth forecast of 6.4%. \"With the new 20% tariff, we think the government will speed up industrial upgrading and shift exports from low-margin goods to higher value-added products such as semiconductors,\" it said in a note. Dominic Scriven, founder and chairman of investment firm Dragon Capital, said the trade deal is \"net-positive\" and the potential GDP hit is less severe than feared. \"With external trade risk now moderating, attention can return to the country's core growth engine, the domestic and private sector economy,\" he said.

Investors had been on edge for weeks about the prospect of Powell being removed from his job before his term ends next May, as Trump has repeatedly criticised him for not cutting U.S. rates quickly enough. COMMENTS: JAMIE COX, MANAGING PARTNER, HARRIS FINANCIAL GROUP, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA: “The President would be making a mistake to fire Chair Powell. Federal Reserve independence is critical to money policy effectiveness, and the last thing the country needs is monetary policy by Presidential fiat. If the President messes with the Chairman, the Congress might use it as an excuse to step in to make changes to the Federal Reserve Act--none of these would be good for monetary policy integrity.” CHRISTOPHER HODGE, CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR US, NATIXIS, NEW YORK: “Much of Fed governance and process is informal, relying on norms and traditions, rather than statute. These norms have been developed over decades and have helped cement the Fed as a credible, trusted, and non-partisan institution that helps to smooth expectations volatility, rather than add to it. \"Maintaining the current traditions is the best route, but even if an alternative path is taken, there are likely sufficient guardrails to prevent a sustained and significant erosion of Fed credibility. If the new Chair is not viewed as credible and nonpartisan, there risks a serious split on FOMC decisions. In this light, selecting Waller as the replacement makes the most sense,” KENNETH BROUX, HEAD OF CORPORATE RESEARCH FX AND RATES, SOCIETE GENERALE, LONDON: \"This story keeps churning so understandably markets are nervous that it could happen sooner rather than later re Trump firing Powell. Bond and FX markets do not like the uncertainty. We've had stronger U.S. CPI goods ex-autos just yesterday so to think that lower rates are the way forward as tariffs seep through consumer prices is not going to reassure. Hence long end USTs (US Treasuries)selling off versus the front end and the dollar is down.\" JUAN PEREZ, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF TRADING, MONEX USA, WASHINGTON: “Ultimately, what drives the U.S. dollar up in value against its peers, against everything is the idea that we have a financial system that's very centered around the U.S. dollar, and it is also a safe-haven asset.” “What can kill the value of the U.S. dollar, what can absolutely destroy faith in the U.S. dollar, is attacking in any way, shape, or form the independence and authority of the Federal Reserve. Ultimately, when it comes to respecting and adhering to this concept of the U.S. dollar as a safe-haven asset in the midst of turbulence, that turbulence cannot affect or inflict pain when it comes to the greatest financial authority in the form of the Fed. \"But if politics, or if the White House, or if anybody can interfere with that, or wants to actively do so, that is absolutely a very, very negative thing for how the U.S. dollar is viewed, how the U.S. dollar is traded, and how people look at the dollar for the future.” “In times of physical disturbance to the world, of geopolitical conflict, it makes sense to hold on to the U.S. dollar, but you're not going to hold on to the U.S. dollar if the one thing that makes it so solid, the Fed, is under attack. It really comes down to that.” PAUL NOLTE, SENIOR WEALTH ADVISOR & MARKET STRATEGIST, MURPHY & SYLVEST, ELMHURST, ILLINOIS: “(Trump’s) going to have to go through litigation in order to do it. He's just not going to be able to pink slip it like he did with different departments, the Department of Education or USAID or anything like that. So there is a process and to my knowledge, it has never happened before. So I'm not sure that it's going to be effective, other than to roil the market.” “My understanding of the Federal Reserve and what can and can't be done – and this has been reviewed by others – is that this is not something he's going to be able to pull off and I'm not sure the Supreme Court is going to go along with it.” “You’re now throwing up a lot of unknowns. Who's going to come in? What are they going to do? Will interest rates go down? Is that going to further inflation?” “Powell has been steady. He's been consistent. Has he made mistakes? Yep. Everybody that's been in that position has. So I'm not sure that putting somebody new in there is going to fix all of those issues, but it does add an element of very much uncertainty to monetary policy.” STEVE SOSNICK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, CONNECTICUT: \"Markets should be concerned about potential interference in the Fed's independence.\" \"Dollar plunging is what you'd expect. Short term rates getting hit going much lower is what you'd expect because whoever (Trump) put in would presumably be much more willing to cut rates. \"Stocks' reaction is a little muted because firstly traders remain loath to sell, they're just so programmed to try to buy dips that they're not eager to sell.\" \"Secondly because perhaps there are some traders who like the idea of lower rates more than more than the loss of independence.\" RICK MECKLER, PARTNER, CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS, A FAMILY INVESTMENT OFFICE, NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY: \"It would be a big mistake on (Trump's) part if he is concerned about the markets and the dollar. An independent Fed gives balance between monetary and fiscal policy. I don't think that lowering rates here any small amount will really impact much about the economy. It might impact the debt interest payments but that's about it.\" \"One problem with this administration is they try and do an awful lot at the same time. And I don't know whether that's to try and get more things through rather than have a battle with Democrats over any one thing.\" \"But investors like orderly, carefully planned moves and this smacks of something that's just creating disorder and ramifications that I don't think the administration has completely thought out.\" \"It's a very unpredictable administration and that Trump in particular seems to take umbrage at the idea that he doesn't follow through on some of these things. So it wouldn't surprise me if they did (fire Powell). It wouldn't surprise me if they didn't. That's one of the problems in assessing investments under this administration is that there often is no clear path as to what's going to happen. And there's an awful lot of rhetoric that doesn't necessarily result in any specific action. So those are recipes for volatility but are not particularly good in terms of planning, either for corporate planning or for investment planning.\" \"It's very similar to the tariff situation. There's a lot of news that could be very meaningful, but no clear indication of whether it's going to come to fruition or not. So it just leaves a lot of investors confused, and many of them sitting on the sidelines trying to get a sense of where we're headed as a country financially.\" MARCO VAILATI, HEAD OF RESEARCH AND INVESTMENTS, CASSA LOMBARDA, MILAN: \"It remains to be seen whether Trump will follow through on this threat. Such a move would almost certainly alarm the market, as it would call into question the Fed's independence from political authority. A less independent Fed, more beholden to this political leadership, would raise concerns — not so much about solvency, but about the very reliability of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.\" FRANCESCO PESOLE, FX STRATEGIST, ING, LONDON: \"If we get a headline today on Powell (removal), then we are looking at much more bigger sell-off in the dollar. Federal Reserve independence is the foundation the U.S.' status as the No.1 reserve currency.\" \"Given the implications of removing a Fed chair, the reaction is still relatively contained. Euro/dollar is at $1.17 and should be trading higher on this, because the implications are massive. Markets are still not fully pricing this all in. You would expect that if Powell is removed today, then the Fed cuts in September.\" CHRIS BEAUCHAMP, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, IG, LONDON: \"The news has put the dollar firmly on the back foot but has dragged stocks lower too. The Fed chairman’s departure would leave the independence of the central bank in question. It seems likely that his (Trump's) recent successes in passing his tax and spending bill, and the ceasefire in the Middle East, have emboldened the president to act.\" \"Now we will see if the bond market vigilantes will put the U.S. in their sights again. Such a dramatic move also suggests there is no backing down from tariffs this time around, especially with stocks at record highs.\" LEE HARDMAN, SENIOR CURRENCY ANALYST, MUFG, LONDON: \"If that does happen (Trump fires Powell), it would be very damaging for investor confidence in the dollar, that’s why we’re starting to see the heavy selling, and it could extend further if he were to do so. \"It’s not clear-cut whether Trump has the power to fire Powell, so we would expect to see a legal challenge very quickly, but even if it were overruled, the hit to confidence would be long lasting, and it reinforces our bearish outlook on the dollar.\" Reporting by EMEA and U.S. breaking news teams Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab"

The Presidential Office/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab SEOUL, July 10 (Reuters) - Since South Korea's Constitutional Court ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol in April, he has lost presidential immunity and is vulnerable to additional charges on top of an ongoing criminal trial concerning his martial law declaration on December 3. Yoon is on trial over insurrection charges, along with a former cabinet minister, several military commanders and police officials. Sign up here. Here is what we know about the criminal investigations and trial so far: WHO IS FACING CHARGES? Yoon is on a criminal trial in which prosecutors accuse him of lacking the legal grounds to declare martial law and ordering troops to arrest lawmakers. Yoon, who has been charged with masterminding an insurrection, has denied all the charges and argued that his martial law declaration, which lasted about six hours, did not amount to insurrection. As a defendant in a criminal trial, Yoon is required to attend arguments heard at the Seoul Central District Court. His former defence minister, Kim Yong-hyun, has been arrested and indicted over alleged insurrection and abuse of power. Chiefs of the Capital Defence Command and the Defence Counterintelligence Command have also been indicted. Others involved in the case include army chief Park An-su, who was named martial law commander and has been indicted. The army's Special Warfare Command as well as several other military generals and senior police officials, including the national and Seoul police chiefs, are also accused of playing a role in the martial law plan. Yoon, Kim, Lee, the police chiefs and more than 10 military commanders have been banned from leaving the country. Yoon became the first sitting president to be arrested on January 15 after a dramatic showdown with law enforcement officials. He was released from jail on March 8 after a court cancelled his arrest warrant, citing the timing of the indictment and questions about the legality of the investigation. But the former leader returned to jail on July 10, after the court granted a detention warrant requested by a special prosecution team investigating additional charges. WHAT CHARGES ARE SOUGHT? In what had been the first-ever criminal prosecution of an incumbent leader, Yoon was indicted in January on charges of leading an insurrection. Other officials also face charges of insurrection, abuse of authority and obstructing other people from exercising their rights. South Korean investigating authorities pursued the charge against Yoon because insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a sitting South Korean president does not have immunity. However, with Yoon having lost immunity, he is now open to other potential charges prosecutors may bring against him. If convicted, leading an insurrection is punishable with life imprisonment with or without labour, or death. For those who engaged in activities key to the insurrection, punishment could range from death to life imprisonment to imprisonment without labour for at least five years. South Korea last handed down a death sentence in 2016, but has not executed anyone since 1997. People who joined in the plot or violence face imprisonment, with or without labour, for less than five years. The special counsel team that kicked off after new leader Lee Jae Myung took office in June is investigating other allegations, including whether Yoon hurt South Korea's interests by intentionally inflaming tensions with North Korea.

The startup is in discussion with two potential partners: Humain, a Saudi-backed AI company offering xAI several gigawatts of capacity, and another company building a smaller but more immediately available 200-megawatt facility, according to the report. Sign up here. The Humain proposal remains distant, Bloomberg reported, as the startup launched by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is yet to break ground on much of the infrastructure it has pledged to build. The other company, which Bloomberg did not name, is already working on the 200-megawatt facility, making it a more realistic short-term option for xAI, the report said. XAI and Humain did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The AI startup has been ramping up its data center capacity to train more advanced models, as it looks to compete more effectively with OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude. Its supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus, is touted as the largest in the world. Saudi Arabia's PIF sovereign wealth fund is expected to play a large role as xAI looks to raise more money from investors in a deal that could value it between $170 billion and $200 billion, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

    "full_text": "Summary Companies Kuvimba struggles to raise $450 mln for initial plan Platinum prices up 36% in second quarter Analysts expect price rise to accelerate other projects By Chris Takudzwa Muronzi HARARE, July 16 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's Kuvimba Mining House will develop its Darwendale platinum project as an open pit rather than the previously planned underground mine, CEO Trevor Barnard said, speeding up the delayed venture as platinum prices rise. Sign up here. Launched by former President Robert Mugabe and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov in September 2014, the project was initially designed as an underground mine that would cost about $450 million in the first phase and become Zimbabwe's biggest mining venture. It was thrown into jeopardy in 2022 when Kuvimba's Russian joint venture partner withdrew and prices of the platinum group metals, mostly used to curb vehicle emissions, collapsed. Barnard told Reuters in an interview Kuvimba had shifted from its \"big bang approach\" and would start with an open pit at an initial cost of $50 million. \"That is quite a change in scope and phasing,\" Barnard said. \"It's very difficult to raise $450 million specifically for a platinum project and in Zimbabwe.\" Instead, funds would be sourced from parent company, Zimbabwe's sovereign wealth fund Mutapa, internally generated cash and a \"bit of debt,\" he added. The diversified mining company also has three operational gold mines that produced 116,000 ounces in 2024. Analysts say rising platinum prices , driven by a surge in Chinese imports and a drop in supply from major producer South Africa, could more generally stimulate projects halted during the price trough. Platinum prices rose 36% during the second quarter. In June alone, prices jumped 28% as hedge funds and speculative traders piled in, notching their strongest month since 1986 and hitting an 11-year high of $1,432.6 an ounce. Tharisa (THST.L) , opens new tab , which delayed its $391 million Karo PGM project in Zimbabwe due to low metal prices, said on July 9 it was working \"to accelerate the final development\" of the mine, as improving commodity prices boosted its balance sheet.
